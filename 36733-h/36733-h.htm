<h1>Molly Brown&rsquo;s College<br />
Friends</h1>


<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>NANCE OLDHAM</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I am so afraid Nance will be changed,&rdquo;
sighed Molly as she put the finishing touches to
the room her old friend was to occupy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager anything she is the same old Nance
Oldham,&rdquo; insisted Professor Green, obediently
mounting the ladder to hang the last snowy curtain
at the broad, deep window in the guest
chamber overlooking the campus. &ldquo;I think she
is the kind of girl who will always be the same.
Is that straight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little bit lower at this end&mdash;there! What
a comfort you are, Edwin!&rdquo; and Molly viewed
the effect approvingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good general houseworker, eh?&rdquo; and
the dignified professor of English at Wellington
College ran nimbly down the ladder and hugged
his wife. She submitted with very good grace to
his embraces in spite of the fact that the fresh
bureau scarves and table covers with which she
was preparing to decorate her old friend&rsquo;s room
were included in the demonstration of affection.</p>

<p>Professor Edwin Green always declared that
he never expected to catch up on all the years
he had loved Molly Brown and had been forced
to let &ldquo;concealment like a worm in the bud feed
on his damask cheek.&rdquo; He and Molly had been
married almost four years on that day in March
when he was assisting in the imposing rite of
hanging curtains in the guest chamber, and she
was still as wonderful to him as she had been on
that day they had walked through the Forest of
Fontainebleau and he had confessed his love. She
was the same charming girl who had lingered too
long in the cloisters and been locked in to be
rescued by him on her first day at college, now
so many years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, Molly Brown has changed very little
since last we saw her. Little Mildred is walking
and talking and singing little tunes and saying
Mother Goose rhymes. She even knows her letters
upside down and no other way, having
learned them from blocks, presumably standing
on her curly head as she acquired the knowledge.</p>

<p>There is another baby in the nursery now:
little Dodo, whose real name is George, a remarkably
satisfactory infant who sleeps when he
should and wakes in a good humor, taking the
proper nourishment at the proper hours and going
back to sleep. Molly had learned the great
secret of young motherhood from her first born:
not to take parenthood too solemnly and seriously,
and to realize that Mother Nature is the
very best mother of all and babies thrive most
when left as much as possible to her all-wise and
tender care.</p>

<p>Nance Oldham, Molly&rsquo;s old friend and roommate
at college, was coming at last to make her
long promised visit to the Greens. Little wonder
that Molly feared she would be changed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Nance&rsquo;s path in life had not been strewn with
roses. No doubt my readers will remember that
Mrs. Oldham, her mother, was a clever woman,
lecturer, suffrage agitator, anything but a homemaker.
When Nance finished college she had
gone back to Vermont and dutifully kept house
for her neglected father, although her secret ambition
was to teach. Mr. Oldham had been so
happy in having a home of his own that Nance
had felt fully repaid for her sacrifice. Her
mother, too, had at last realized the delights of
home, when someone else had the trouble of keeping
it, and had spent much more time with her
family than she had for many years.</p>

<p>A lingering illness had attacked Mr. Oldham
and after two years of tender nursing on the
part of his daughter and futile ineffectual attempts
at tenderness on the part of his wife, the
poor man had passed away. Then it was that
Nance&rsquo;s friends had felt that her career might
begin, but Mrs. Oldham had suddenly decided
that she could not live without the husband who
had been ever patient with her vagaries and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had gone into a slow decline. More nursing and
self-denial for the patient Nance!</p>

<p>She was an orphan now and although she was
in reality little more than a girl she felt old and
settled, that the little youth she had ever had, had
left her years ago. Molly had written her immediately
on hearing of Mrs. Oldham&rsquo;s death, declaring
that she and her Edwin were ready and
eager for the long-deferred visit. &ldquo;I say
&lsquo;visit,&rsquo;&rdquo; wrote Molly, &ldquo;but I want you to make
your home with us. Little Mildred calls you
Aunt Nance and Dodo will call you the same as
soon as he can talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guest chamber was now in perfect order.
The fresh curtains hung as straight as a learned
professor of English could hang them, the bureau
scarf and table cover were smooth and spotless,
and on the window sill blossomed a pot of sweet
violets sent by Mrs. McLean from her own
greenhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder about Nance and Andy McLean,&rdquo;
said Molly, as she and her husband were walking
to the station to meet their guest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder what about them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder if they will ever marry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! I fancy it was just a schoolgirl affair.
They don&rsquo;t often amount to much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Schoolgirl affairs can be right serious, as
you of all others should know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, some of them!&rdquo; said Edwin
devoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon Nance will be in deep mourning,&rdquo;
sighed Molly. &ldquo;I hate mourning,&mdash;I mean long
veils and crêpe trimmings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&mdash;a relic of barbarism!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give up my literary club for a while. I
know Nance will not feel like seeing a lot of
young people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Green said nothing but he felt it
was rather hard on Wellington that any of its
pleasures should be curtailed because of the death
of a lady in Vermont. But Molly must do what
she thought best. He hoped their guest would
not put too long a face on life and would not
prove inconsolable.</p>

<p>The long train stopped at the little station at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Wellington and Molly and her husband eagerly
scanned the few passengers who alighted from
the Pullman. One lady in a long crêpe veil got
an embrace from the impulsive Molly but she
turned out to be an utter stranger and not the
beloved Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, she did, but she came on a day
coach,&rdquo; and there was Nance hugging Molly and
shaking hands with Professor Green at the same
time.</p>

<p>That gentleman was viewing his wife&rsquo;s old
friend with great satisfaction. Instead of the
long crêpe veil and the lugubrious black-clothed
figure, here was a slight young woman in a
neat brown suit and furs, with a close brown
velvet toque and a chic little dotted brown
veil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance! I was expecting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you were expecting to find me
swathed in black. I am doing what Mother
asked me to do. She hated mourning and so did
Father and I am a fright in black and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
have meant a new outfit, which I can ill afford,
and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you are a sensible girl,&rdquo; said Professor
Green approvingly, as he took possession
of her traveling bag and trunk check.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance, you are not changed one bit!&rdquo;
cried Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are changed a lot,&rdquo; said the truthful
Nance, &ldquo;but you are more beautiful. In fact,
you never were really beautiful before, but now,
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, spare my blushes!&rdquo; cried Molly, who
did not spare herself but blushed and blushed
and blushed again.</p>

<p>Nance was the same little brown-eyed person
with the same honest look out of those eyes. In
repose her mouth did have a slight droop at the
corners but otherwise she might have been a college
girl still, so youthful were her lines and so
clear and rosy her healthy skin. Her hair was as
Molly had always remembered it, smooth and
glossy with much brushing and every lock in
place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you tired, honey? If you are, we can
go home in the bus,&rdquo; suggested Molly. &ldquo;Look
what a fine motor bus we have now! Do you
remember the old yellow one with the lame
horses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I? And also that I met you right at this
station when we were both freshmen and we rode
up in that bus together. Oh, Molly, it is wonderful
to be here with you! No, I&rsquo;m not tired, so
let&rsquo;s walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor was due for lectures and the
girls left him without reluctance. Even husbands
were superfluous when such old friends met after
being separated for so many years. There was
so much to talk about, so many loose threads to
catch up, so much belated news that had not
seemed important enough to write.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying to see the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are lovely! There is Mildred now waving
to us from your window. I wonder what she
is doing in there. I do hope she has not got into
mischief,&rdquo; said Molly uneasily.</p>

<p>The guest chamber was still spotless and Molly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
breathed a sigh of relief. She had had visions of
the irrepressible Mildred&rsquo;s making dolly sheets of
the bureau scarf or of putting her black kitten to
sleep in the snowy bed. The chubby imp was
standing with her back to the window, her hands
behind her. Her golden curls made a halo
around her charming face, her brown eyes were
soft and dreamy and her rosebud mouth looked
as though butter would not melt in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, darling, and speak to Aunt Nance,&rdquo;
said Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no Aunt Nance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mildred!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Molly! Don&rsquo;t force her. She
and I will end by being sweethearts, I am sure,&rdquo;
said Nance laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Dodo will be your sweetheart
now,&rdquo; declared Molly, going through all the
agony of motherhood when the offspring refuses
to be polite. &ldquo;You may go to Katy, Mildred,&rdquo;
in a tone as severe as she could make it.</p>

<p>Mildred sidled around, carefully keeping her
back to her mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you in your hand, darling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I been a-tuttin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scissors! Oh, Mildred, you know how afraid
your mother is for you to play with scissors!
What am I to do with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mildred made a sudden resolution. Why not
throw herself on the mercy of this new aunt for
protection. She darted by her mother and
sprang into the ready arms of Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I been a-tuttin&rsquo; a bunch of vi&rsquo;lets for my
Aunt Nance&mdash;an&rsquo; I been a-fwingin&rsquo; her curtains
all pretty for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In one hand she had tightly clasped a huge
pair of shears and in the other the violets which
she had ruthlessly culled from the pot sent by
Mrs. McLean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mildred, see what you have done,&rdquo; agonized
Molly. &ldquo;Mrs. McLean sent them to you,
Nance. I am so sorry they are spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are not,&rdquo; declared Nance, trying to
keep down the blush that would come at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
knowledge that Andy McLean&rsquo;s mother had
shown her this attention. &ldquo;We can put this dear
little bunch in water, and I am sure there are
many more buds to bloom. Let&rsquo;s see, Mildred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed they is! I wouldn&rsquo;t cut no li&rsquo;l baby
buds off for nothin&rsquo; or nothin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no bad
Milly in this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the curtains!&rdquo; wailed poor Molly when
she viewed the neat fringes that her daughter had
so carefully slashed with the great shears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; insisted
Nance. &ldquo;Mildred and I are going to cut them
off and hem them up. Aren&rsquo;t we, Mildred?
Very short curtains are all the style now, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed the wily Mildred eagerly,
&ldquo;the windows likes to show they silk stockings,
jes&rsquo; like the ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you darling!&rdquo; cried Nance, sinking
down and holding the child in her arms, while
Molly rescued the long and dangerous shears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Muvver, you needn&rsquo;t to worry no mo&rsquo;,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Aunt Nance an&rsquo; I is done made up an&rsquo; I done
forgive her an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about you! Who has forgiven
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me! I done forgive myself &rsquo;long with Aunt
Nance. I say right easy way down inside me:
&lsquo;Milly, &rsquo;scuse me!&rsquo; An&rsquo; then way down inside
me say mos&rsquo; politeful: &lsquo;You&rsquo;s &rsquo;scusable, darlin&rsquo;
chil&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, how can you resist her?&rdquo; asked
Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t reckon I can,&rdquo; said Molly,
whimsically. &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t do it any more,
will you, Mildred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&rsquo;m, never in my world&mdash;cross my heart
an&rsquo; wish I may die&mdash;bake a puddin&rsquo; bake a pie did
you ever tell a lie yes you did you know you did
you broke yo&rsquo; mammy&rsquo;s teapot lid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of Kizzie&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; laughed Molly,
remembering in her childhood saying exactly the
same thing.</p>

<p>And so Nance Oldham was received into the
home of the Edwin Greens. Already she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
won the approval of the master by appearing in
colors and not swathed in black (men always do
hate mourning). Mildred had decided to love
and honor and make her obey. Little Dodo soon
accepted her lap as an especially nice place to
spend his few waking moments, and Molly&rsquo;s love
and welcome were assured from the beginning of
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>BY THE FIRELIGHT</small></h2>


<p>The only home Nance Oldham had ever
known she had made herself after she left college.
Her childhood and girlhood had been spent in
boarding houses with her patient father, while
her brilliant mother made occasional hurried and
preoccupied visits to them. There had been a
time when Nance had felt bitterly towards her
mother because she was not as other mothers
were, but the realization had finally come to her
that her mother could no more be as other
mothers than other mothers could be as Mrs. Oldham
was. She had decided that instead of her
mother&rsquo;s being a mistake, that she, Nance, was
the mistake. She should never have been born;
but now that she was born she intended to make
the best of it. The fact that she had never had a
home made a home just that much more precious
and desirable in her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>What a lovely home this square old brick house
on the campus made! Nance remembered well
in her college days that it was not such a very
attractive place, rather bleak, in fact. It needed
a mistress, the soul of a house; and now in place
of the blank uncurtained windows of old days,
Molly&rsquo;s genial hospitality and kindness seemed
to look out from every pane of glass. The college
girls named Mrs. Edwin Green &ldquo;The Fairy
Godmother of Wellington.&rdquo; She was called into
consultation on every occasion. The President
of Wellington wondered if it were not incumbent
upon her to offer Molly a salary for her services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we would do without her.
I believe the college would simply go to pieces
without Mrs. Edwin Green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The students, old and young, rich and poor,
flocked to the brick house which they dubbed
&ldquo;The Square Deal.&rdquo; There Molly administered
advice and love and sympathy with absolute impartiality,
also with perfect unconsciousness that
she was the guiding star of the student body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the only really truly democratic person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I ever knew,&mdash;of course, besides O. Henry, and I
didn&rsquo;t exactly know him,&rdquo; Billie McKym declared.
&ldquo;She and O. Henry simply don&rsquo;t regard
money one way or the other in their judgment
of persons. Now most social workers think
of the rich as necessary evils in the way of pocketbooks
and such. They really take no interest in
anyone who does not need financial or moral help,
but Molly and O. Henry are just as good to the
rich as the poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billie was back at Wellington taking extra
courses that she wasn&rsquo;t certain what she was to
do with, but she felt anything was preferable to
coming out into society in New York, which was
the inevitable sequence the moment she was
through with college.</p>

<p>Billie rather resented the guest at the Square
Deal as did many of Molly&rsquo;s youthful friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never any seeing Molly alone now,&rdquo;
she grumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; agreed Mary Neil, a red-headed
junior who had what she termed a &ldquo;mash&rdquo; on
Mrs. Green. Molly, being totally unaware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
this, was ever causing the poor girl to turn green
with jealousy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of her stopping the &lsquo;Would-be&rsquo;s&rsquo;
just because Miss Oldham&rsquo;s mother died, and she
didn&rsquo;t even think enough of her to put on mourning,&rdquo;
asserted Lilian Swift as she peeped in the
mirror over the mantel to adjust her own very becoming
black and white hat, worn as second
mourning for a great-aunt who had left her a
legacy.</p>

<p>These girls were assembled in the library at
the Greens&rsquo;, waiting to see their friend. That
evening the &ldquo;Would-be Authors&rsquo; Club&rdquo; was to
have met, but Molly, their president, had felt it
best to postpone it because of Nance&rsquo;s recent bereavement.
The &ldquo;Would-be Authors&rdquo; was now
a flourishing organization with a waiting list that
almost stretched around the campus. They met
together for mutual benefit and encouragement
and sometimes for discouragement. The only
requisite for membership was to scribble at fiction.
On coming into this club it was necessary
to pledge oneself to take a criticism like a man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
No matter how severe a drubbing your story
called forth, you must smile and smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls, I&rsquo;m so sorry to keep you waiting, but
Mildred had got chewing-gum in her hair and I
simply had to get it out before her whole wig
stuck together,&rdquo; said Molly as she came in with
Dodo in her arms and Mildred trotting after her
like a veritable little colt following its dam.
&ldquo;My friend, Miss Oldham, will be down in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls looked at one another meaningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want all of you to like my friend,&rdquo; continued
Molly, as though she could divine their
thoughts. &ldquo;She has had a hard time and she
needs the companionship of young people more
than anyone I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly then told them of Nance&rsquo;s devotion to
her mother and father, of her thwarted ambition,
of her unselfishness and cleverness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems strange for her not to wear mourning
for her mother,&rdquo; said Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it does, but when you think of it,
what you wear has nothing to do with your feelings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
It is in a way part of Nance&rsquo;s unselfishness
that she did not put on mourning. Her
father disliked it, her mother could not abide it,
and as she said, it meant a new outfit which she
could ill afford. It is a great deal easier just to
give up to grief and exude gloom than it is to be
cheerful and radiate light and happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was in a measure irritated by Lilian&rsquo;s
criticism of her beloved Nance, but Lilian was a
person who always spoke her mind no matter
what was involved, and she had a certain sturdiness
and honesty of opinion that disarmed
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she answered bluntly,
&ldquo;but while she is being so unselfish about her
clothes, why doesn&rsquo;t she spunk up a bit about the
&lsquo;Would-be Authors?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, postponing the meeting because she is
in such deep grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t Nance. I am responsible for
that foolishness. She only found out about it to-day
and declares she will go back to Vermont if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
dare make a single change in my way of living.
I want all of you to get messages to the club to
be sure and come this evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully for Nance!&rdquo; cried Billie McKym.</p>

<p>Nance came into the room just as Billie was
cheering her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad it&rsquo;s bully for me, if I&rsquo;m the
Nance. But why &lsquo;Bully for Nance&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just because you are here with Mrs. Green
and can come to our literary club this evening,&rdquo;
said Billie with a straight face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am no scribbler,&rdquo; declared Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are a wonderful critic,&rdquo; said Molly.
&ldquo;Among so many scribblers it is well to have one
sane person willing to compose the audience. It
is my turn to read to-night and I want your criticism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can come in that capacity, I am more
than willing,&rdquo; smiled Nance as she settled herself
to her knitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember many times you saved me from
making a bombastic goose of myself on my college
themes,&rdquo; laughed Molly. &ldquo;What I flattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
myself was pathos, under your cool judgment
turned out often to be bathos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly leaned over and gave her friend an affectionate
pat. At this show of love, Mary Neil
jumped up so suddenly that she upset little Mildred,
who was sitting on the sofa by her, and
without saying a word rushed from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The suddenness of Mary,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared
Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good title for a story!&rdquo; said Lilian, getting
out a note-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you scribblers!&rdquo; laughed Nance.</p>

<p>Little Mildred was picked up and comforted
and in a short while the visitors took their departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, do you know what was the matter
with that interesting looking red-headed girl?&rdquo;
asked Nance as they settled to the delights of a
twilight chat, while Nance busily plied her knitting
needles on the long drab scarf that seemed to
grow under her agile fingers like magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She was jealous of me. I noticed how she
looked at me when I came in and she never said a
single word while all of us were chatting. Then
the moment you gave me a little pat, she jumped
up as though she had received an electric shock
and fled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absurd! I hate to think it of Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true all the same. Didn&rsquo;t you know she
was crazy about you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t want to know it. A girl had
better be beau-crazy than have these silly cases
with other girls. I am going to put a stop to it
in some way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might do like Peg Woffington and put my
hair up in curl papers and appear at my very
worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dearie, your worst might be so much
better than some person&rsquo;s best that that might not
work. But don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve got a case on
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never! We were foolish enough college
girls but we never were that foolish. I can&rsquo;t remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
anyone in our crowd having these silly
mashes. Can you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless it was the affair Judy Kean had with
Adele Windsor. Do you remember when poor
Judy turned up with her hair dyed a blue
black?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; and the friends went off into peals of
laughter just as Mrs. McLean ushered herself
into the firelit room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The door was open so I came right in,&rdquo; announced
that dear woman. She caught Nance&rsquo;s
hands in a strong grasp and drew the girl towards
her. &ldquo;I am glad to see you, my dear,&rdquo; she
said simply. Her well-remembered Scotch accent
fell pleasingly on Nance&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The violets were lovely. I thank you so
much,&rdquo; faltered Nance.</p>

<p>Molly wondered at the embarrassment of her
friend. She had longed to talk to Nance about
Andy McLean but did not know how to begin.
She shrank from prying into her guest&rsquo;s affairs,
but the eternal feminine in her was on the alert
for the romance she had no doubt was there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I must tell you all about Andy,&rdquo;
said his fond mother. &ldquo;I know you want to hear
about him,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we do,&rdquo; put in Molly quickly, while
Nance tried to go on with her knitting, but I am
afraid dropped more stitches than she picked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has resigned from the hospital staff in
New York where he was doing so splendidly and
is to go to France as an ambulance surgeon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; came involuntarily from Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what he should do,&rdquo; declared his Spartan
mother. &ldquo;His father and I would not have
it otherwise. Of course, the States will be at
war before the month is out and Andy might wait
and enlist with his own country, but in the meantime
he is needed, and sadly needed, by my country,
mine and his father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will come see you before he sails, will he
not?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! He may spend a month with
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be splendid indeed.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Nance said nothing, but the flames that sprang
from the wood fire lit up a very rosy countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going now. I only ran in for a
moment to bring the news of my Andy and to see
this little friend again. Come to see me, both of
you,&rdquo; and the doctor&rsquo;s wife was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly! I should never have come to you!&rdquo;
said Nance the moment the door closed on their
visitor. Katy, the Irish nurse, had come for the
baby. Little Mildred had fallen asleep, her head
in Nance&rsquo;s lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling girl! Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spoil Andy&rsquo;s visit to his mother.
If I am here, it will be spoiled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance, how can you say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is the truth. He will have to see
me, and he hates me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He left me two years ago in a rage and swore
it was over for good and all; and he couldn&rsquo;t
have said such things to me if he had not hated
me.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;do you hate him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; and again the flickering fire
showed off her blushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say nothing to him but nice
things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We-ll, not exactly,&mdash;but he said the things he
said first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were the things he said worse than the things
you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; with a toss of her independent head,
&ldquo;I gave him back as good as he sent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done it. You knew how
the things he said hurt, and with your superior
knowledge of what it meant to be wounded, you
were cruel to hurt him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he should have known! That kind of
philosophy is above me. Suppose the Allies conducted
their warfare under those principles, what
would become of us? Germany hit first and
France and Belgium knew how it hurt, and so
they should not have hit back. There is a big
hole in your reasoning, honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that is not the same. Germany and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
France didn&rsquo;t love one another, while you and
Andy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is all over now!&rdquo; and Nance composed
herself and tried to go on with her knitting.
Molly thought in her heart perhaps it was not so
&ldquo;over&rdquo; as Nance thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you and Andy quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had promised when Father no longer
needed me that I would&mdash;would&mdash;marry him.
How could I tell that Mother would want to
come live with me when poor Father was gone?
Andy came as soon as he learned of Father&rsquo;s
death and seemed to think I could pick right up
and marry him, and when I objected to such unseemly
haste he said I had been flirting with him.
The idea of such a thing! He got it into his
head that Dr. Flint, the physician who had been
with us through poor Father&rsquo;s long illness, was
the cause of my holding back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he&mdash;was he&mdash;attentive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;well, yes&mdash;he did propose to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
but I had no idea of accepting him. Andy should
have known me well enough to realize that I
couldn&rsquo;t be so low as to jilt him. When Andy
came, Mother had just told me that she never expected
to leave me again. I never did have a
chance to tell this to him, he was so angry and so
jealous. He wanted me to marry him immediately
and leave Vermont,&mdash;and how could I when
Mother was home, sick and miserable and reproaching
herself for having been away from
Father so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your mother not know of your engagement
to Andy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No-o! You see, poor Mother was not&mdash;was
not the kind of mother one confided in much.
Afterwards, when I nursed her through all those
months, she was so softened if I had had anything
to confide I should have done so, but then there
was nothing left to confide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old Nance!&rdquo; said Molly lovingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sorry for myself a bit. No
doubt I might have gone whining to Andy and
made him take back all the things he said, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
am no whiner. It was a good thing we found out
in time we could say such things to each other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was a good thing to find out in time
how it hurt to say such things and have such
things said to one, and then it would never happen
again,&rdquo; said the hopeful Molly.</p>

<p>Nance divined that Molly was thinking how
best she could bring these two estranged lovers
together, and determined to frustrate any matchmaking
plans the young matron might be hatching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise me, Molly, you will not say a thing
to Andy or to anyone. It is something that is
hopelessly mixed up and my pride would never
recover if Andy should know that I cared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do care then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I care! I never had very many
friends and if I cared for Andy enough to engage
myself to him, I could not get over it ever, I am
afraid. But you have not promised yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said Molly sadly. &ldquo;But if you
love Andy, it does seem so foolish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But remember you have promised!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE WOULD-BE&rsquo;S</small></h2>


<p>What a chattering there was as the crowd of
girls gathered for the weekly meeting of their
literary club! Professor Green beat a hasty retreat
from the library. He declared that listening
to schoolgirl fiction was no treat to him. Besides
there was so much to be read concerning the
war in that month of March, 1917, and little time
in which to read it. War was an obsession with
Edwin Green. Waking and sleeping it was ever
with him. He regretted his being unable to enlist
as a private in the French army, so strong
were his sympathies with that struggling nation.
Certain that his country would finally drop its
neutrality and come out strongly for democracy
and the Allies, he could hardly wait for the final
declaration of war. He had his den, safe from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the encroachments of the &ldquo;Would-be Authors&rsquo;
Club,&rdquo; and there he ensconced himself with
enough newspapers and magazines to furnish
reading matter for the whole of Wellington.</p>

<p>The rules of the club were as follows: Two
pieces of original fiction must be read at each
meeting. A chairman for the evening must be
appointed by the two performers. All manuscript
must be written legibly if not typewritten,
so that the club need not have to wait while the
author tried to read her own writing. Criticism
must be given and taken in good humor and good
faith.</p>

<p>Molly, in forming this club, had endeavored
to have in it only those students who were really
interested in short story writing and ambitious to
perfect themselves, but in spite of her ideals there
were some members who were in it for the fun they
got out of it or for a certain prestige they fancied
they would gain from these weekly meetings at
the home of the popular wife of a popular professor.
These slackers were constantly bringing
excuses for plots when their time came to read,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
or trying to work off on the club old essays and
theses on various subjects not in the least related
to fiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to read this evening, I believe,
Mary,&rdquo; said Molly to Mary Neil as the library
filled. &ldquo;You missed last time and so got put on
this week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;you see, I sat up all night
trying to finish a story but couldn&rsquo;t get it to suit
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you bring it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, it was too much in the rough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad, Mary!&rdquo; cried Lilian Swift.
&ldquo;There are plenty of us who had things to read
and you cut us out of the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely some of you must have brought
things,&rdquo; said Molly, trying not to smile, knowing
full well that in almost every pocket of the really
and truly &ldquo;Would-be&rsquo;s&rdquo; some gem of purest ray
serene in the shape of a manuscript was only
waiting to be dived for. The self-conscious expression
on at least a dozen faces put her mind at
rest in regard to the program of the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems I have the appointing of a chairman
for the meeting in my power, since the other
reader has fallen out of the running,&rdquo; said Molly,
looking as severely as she could look at the sullen,
handsome Mary Neil, &ldquo;so I appoint Billie McKym.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billie, a most ardent scribbler, had been drawn
into the procession of short-story fiends by
her dear friend Thelma Larson, who was destined
to become famous as a writer of fiction.
Billie had no great talent but she possessed a
fresh breezy line of dialogue that covered a multitude
of sins in the way of plot formation, motivation,
crisis, climax and what not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, Billie, the chair is not the floor,&rdquo;
teased one of the members.</p>

<p>Billie was a great talker and although she was
no pronounced success as a writer of fiction, she
was a good critic of the performance of others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for that I&rsquo;ll ask you, Miss Smarty, to
serve as vice, and when I have something important
to say I&rsquo;ll put you in the chair for keeps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let Mrs. Green begin and stop squabbling,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
demanded a girl who had a plot she was
dying to divulge and devoutly hoped she would
be called on when their hostess got through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then begin!&rdquo; and Billie rapped for order.</p>

<p>Molly took her seat by the reading-lamp and
opened her manuscript. Having to read before
the club was just as exciting to Molly as to the
veriest freshman. Her cheeks flushed and her
hand trembled a wee bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly of me to get stage fright but I can&rsquo;t
help it,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you reckon we feel then?&rdquo; drawled
a little girl from Alabama, who only the week before
had been torn limb from limb by the relentless
&ldquo;Would-be&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a story that I have sent on many a
journey and it always comes back to its doting
mother. I have received several personal letters
about it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, wonderful!&rdquo; came from several members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only think, the most encouraging thing that
has happened to me yet was once a Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
magazine kept my manuscript almost three
weeks,&rdquo; sighed a willowy maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now please criticize it just as severely as you
can. I want to sell it, and something must be
done to it before the editors will take it,&rdquo; begged
Molly, getting over her ridiculous stage fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire away!&rdquo; said parliamentary Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long is it?&rdquo; asked Lilian Swift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About five thousand words, I think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; blew the girl who hoped to get her
plot in edgewise.</p>

<p>There was a general laugh and then Molly
cleared her throat for action. &ldquo;First, let me tell
you I saw a clipping in the <cite>New York Times</cite>
asking for Fairy Godmothers for the soldiers.
That was what put the idea in my head. The
title is: &lsquo;Fairy Godmothers Wanted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>You could have heard a pin drop while Molly
read, and occasionally one did hear the scratching
of a pencil wielded by a member who was on a
critical war-path.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>FAIRY GODMOTHERS WANTED</small></h2>


<p>The ballroom was crowded but very quiet.
The belle of the ball was the night nurse, deftly
accomplishing the many duties that fall to
the share of a night nurse. A letter must be
written for a poor Gascon who had lost his right
arm; a Bedouin chief must be watered every five
minutes; a little red-headed Irishman begging
for morphine to ease his pain, and a sad Cockney
lad sobbing because he was &ldquo;&rsquo;omesick for &rsquo;Ammersmith,&rdquo;
must be comforted.</p>

<p>The beautiful old château had been converted
into a hospital early in the war and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de
bal</i> was given over to the convalescents. The
convalescent male is a very difficult proposition,
and the little nurse sometimes felt her burden was
greater than she could bear. There was so much
to do for these sick soldiers besides nurse them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
One thing, she must good-naturedly submit to
being made love to in many different languages.
She could stand all but the Bedouin chief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems so like our darkeys at home,&rdquo; she
had whispered to the one American who was getting
well rather faster than he liked to admit.</p>

<p>This American wanted to get well and be back
in the trenches, but who was to make love to the
pretty night nurse in good old American when he
left the convalescent ward?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised to do something for me to-night.
Don&rsquo;t forget! You must be almost
through with all of these fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready in a minute!&rdquo; She flitted down between
the rows of cots, tucking in the covers here,
plumping up a pillow there. The Bedouin was
watered for the last time that night and finally
closed his rolling black eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what is it?&rdquo; she asked, sinking down
on a stool by the American&rsquo;s bed, which was
placed in an alcove at one end of the great salon.
&ldquo;If it is writing a letter, thank goodness, it won&rsquo;t
have to be in the second person singular in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
French. Why do you suppose they teach us
such formal French at school? I can&rsquo;t <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tutoyer</i>
for the life of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je t&rsquo;aime</i>&rsquo;s all I know. But I
don&rsquo;t want you to write a letter for me. I want
you to read some. But first I must know your
really truly name. I&mdash;I&mdash;like you too much
just to have to call you nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary Grubb!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Not really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;d like to know what is the matter
with my name. It is a perfectly good name, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary is beautiful&mdash;but&mdash;the other!
Never mind, you can change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to do so, at least not for
many a day. I think Grubb is especially nice.
It suggests Sally Lunn and batter bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now, I would know you are from the
South even if your dear little &lsquo;reckons&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t
come popping out every now and then. Do you
know, I have a friend who lives in Kentucky, and
when the war is over I have been planning to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
see her, but now&mdash;but now&mdash;I am afraid she
won&rsquo;t want to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the scars?&rdquo; and she looked pityingly
at the young man and put her firm little
hand on his head. &ldquo;Why, they will not amount
to much. They will just make you look interesting.
Your eyes will be well, I just know they
will. Look at this long scar that has given the
most trouble! It has turned to a pleasing pink
and will be almost gone in a few months. You
see you are so healthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t altogether the scars. If you think
they are pretty, maybe she will, too. There is
something else. I want to read over all this
packet of letters before I decide something. You
had better begin or that big, black, bounding beggar
over there will begin to whine for water
again. After you read the letters, maybe I will
tell you the other reason why my friend in Kentucky
might not want to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from under his pillow a packet of little
blue letters, tightly tied with a piece of twine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are! These letters have meant a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
lot to me while I was in the trenches. They still
mean a lot to me. They were written by my
Fairy Godmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Are they love letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! I wouldn&rsquo;t ask a woman to
read another woman&rsquo;s love letters. I wouldn&rsquo;t
let anyone but you read these letters, but my eyes
are too punk to read them myself and I have to&mdash;to
hear them to decide something, something very
important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! A nurse is a kind of father confessor
and what one hears professionally is sacred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, I am not thinking of you as a
nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am thinking of you as a patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She slipped the top letter from the packet and
turned it over. &ldquo;So your name is Stephen
Scott!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know my name, either? How
funny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only know the names of the patients who
have charts, and you are too well to waste a chart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
on. We nurses call you the convalescent American.
Sure these are not love letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; impatiently. &ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t
want to read them to me, just say so. Maybe
you are tired. Of course you are. You look
pale and your little hand is trembling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! I am not tired! Let me begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle de bal</i> of the old château was very
quiet. The wounded soldiers were dropping off
to sleep one by one. Even the Bedouin chief had
stopped rolling his eyes and was softly snoring.
In a low clear voice she read the letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Godson:</span></p>

<p>It is so wonderful to be a Godmother that I
can hardly contain myself for joy. It is through
an advertisement I saw in a New York paper,
headed Fairy Godmothers Wanted, that I happen
to have you and you happen to have me. I consider
our introduction quite regular as it came through
the wife of a great general.</p>

<p>I wonder how you like belonging to me? I wonder
if you are as alone in the world and homeless
as I am. I wonder if you are big or little, dark or
fair, old or young. I wonder all kinds of things
about you,&mdash;after all, it makes no difference, any of
these things. You are my Godson and every day I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
am going to pray for you and think about you. I
am going to send you presents and write you long
letters and send you newspapers. The only trouble
about it is by the time I get hold of English papers
they will be weeks and weeks old. I wonder if
American magazines and papers would appeal to
you. I wonder what kind of presents you would
like,&mdash;not beaded antimacassars and not mouchoir
cases surely. I will knit you a sweater maybe, but
I am not very fond of knitting.</p>

<p>This business of being a Fairy Godmother is a
very serious one, more serious than being a real
mother, I believe. A real mother can at least do
something towards forming the character of her
child, but a Fairy Godmother has her child presented
to her and takes it as the husband used to
take his bride in the old English prayer book:
&ldquo;With all her debts and scandals upon her.&rdquo; The
worst of it is that she is ignorant what those debts
and scandals are. I don&rsquo;t even know what kind of
smoke to send you. Are you middle-aged and sedate
and do you smoke a corn-cob pipe? Are you
young and giddy and do you live on cigarettes? A
terrible possibility has entered into my mind! Are
you one of those awful persons that uses what our
darkeys call &ldquo;eatin&rsquo; tobacco&rdquo;? If so, I shall begin
to train you immediately.</p>

<p>Perhaps you want to know something about me.
There is not much to know. I am an orphan of
independent means and character. Being the first,
enables me to be the second, which sounds like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
riddle but isn&rsquo;t. You see I have rafts and oodlums
of kin, and if I did not have an income of my own
they would step in and coerce me even more than
they do. I said in the beginning that I was homeless.
I am not really that, but the trouble is I have
too many homes. I must spend the winter with
Aunt Sally and the spring with Cousin Kate.
Cousin Maria and Uncle Bruce want me to take
White Sulphur by storm with them as chaperones;
and so it is from one year&rsquo;s end to the other, kind
relations planning for me. I am bored to death
with it all and am even now preparing a bomb to
throw in this camp of overzealous kin. But I&rsquo;ll tell
you about that later,&mdash;that is, if you want to hear
about it. I may be boring you stiff. If I am, it
is an easy matter for you to repudiate me and tell
Mrs. Johnson to get you a more agreeable Godmother.</p>

<p>My numerous family does not at all approve of
my being a Godmother. They think I am too young
for the responsibility and have entered upon it too
lightly. I even heard Aunt Sally whisper to
Cousin Maria: &ldquo;Just like her mother!&rdquo; That
means in their minds that I am headstrong and difficult.
You see my mother was also of independent
means and character. Also (I whisper this) she
was not a Southerner. That is as serious in a
Southerner&rsquo;s eyes as not being British is in yours.
They think it is very forward of me to be writing
to a man what has not been properly introduced.
Uncle Bruce suggests that you may not even be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
born. I tell him soldiers don&rsquo;t have to be born and
that the bravest soldiers that were ever known
sprang up from dragon&rsquo;s teeth.</p>

<p>I am sending you as my first present all kinds of
tobacco, even plug. I must not let my prejudices
get away with me. If my dear Godson likes &ldquo;eatin&rsquo;
tobacco,&rdquo; he shall have it. If you don&rsquo;t indulge in
it, give it to some soldier less dainty. For my part,
I should think the trenches would be dirty enough
without adding to them.</p>

<p>I want to tell you that I like your name. I think
Stephen Scott sounds very manly and upstanding,
somehow. I am hoping for a letter from you just to
give me an inkling of your tastes. Of course I
know one of the duties of a Fairy Godmother is
not to worry her charge, and I don&rsquo;t want to worry
you but to help you. I think of you in those damp,
nasty ditches eating all kinds of food, served in all
kinds of ways. (I am sure what should be hot is
cold, and what should be cold is hot.) And when
I sit down to batter-bread and fried chicken I can
hardly force it down, I do so want you to have it
instead of me.</p>

<p><span class="rght3">Your affectionate Godmother,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">Polly Nelson.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The night nurse quietly folded up the first
letter and slipped it back in its blue envelope.
She had a whimsical, amused expression on her
face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you smiling over? Don&rsquo;t you
think that is a nice letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t say it was. I think that is a
sweet letter. I tell you it meant a lot to me. Of
course, I am not the homeless Tommy she
thought I was. I fancy I have as many Aunt
Sallies and Cousin Marias as she has, but they
happen to be in New England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not an orphan, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;m an orphan all right enough,
but I am related to half of Massachusetts and all
of Boston.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell your Fairy Godmother that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what makes me feel so bad. I
was afraid she would stop being my Godmother
if she found out I was&mdash;well, not exactly poor, so
I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t exactly lie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t exactly tell the truth, either,&rdquo; and
the night nurse curled her pretty lip and looked
disgusted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t be angry with me, too. I
know she will be. I have simply got to tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the truth about myself. I did let her know I am
an American. I am going to write her a letter
just as soon as I can see to do it. But go on with
the next, please. You are sure it is not tiring
you too much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; and the night nurse slipped out another.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Godson:</span></p>

<p>It was very nice of you to answer my letter
so promptly. I am so glad you are an American
and do not chew tobacco. You must not feel compelled
to answer all my letters because you must
be very busy and I have very little to do, so little
that I am becoming very restless. I have thrown
the bomb in the camp of the enemy, my kin. They
are shattered into smithereens. I am going to enter
a hospital, take training, and just as soon as I am
capable go to France with the Red Cross nurses.
I should like to go immediately but I want to be a
help not a hindrance, and they say all the untrained
persons who butt in on the war zone are a nuisance.
Six months of training should make me fit, don&rsquo;t
you think? But how should you know?</p>

<p>I am very happy at the thought of being of some
use. I owe it all to you, my dear Godson. If I had
not been presented with you I should never have
thought of such a thing. Just as soon as I realized
that over in the trenches was a human being who
wanted to hear from me and whom I could help, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
began to take a new interest in the war and all the
soldiers, and then I began to feel that maybe I, insignificant
little I, might be of some use to those
poor soldiers, some use besides just knitting foolish
caps and mittens and sending the <cite>Saturday Evening
Post</cite> and cigarettes. I only wish I could go
immediately. My training begins to-morrow. Aunt
Sally and Cousin Maria feel that it is a terrible
blot on the family name. They are sure someone
will say that I am doing this because I am not a
success in society, although they say over and over
that I am. I don&rsquo;t know whether I am or not, all
I know is that society is not a success with me.
Uncle Bruce is rather nice about it all.</p>

<p>There are so many I&rsquo;s in this letter I am mortified.
I believe writing to a Godson in the trenches
is almost like keeping a diary. I am sending you
some cards and poker chips (but you mustn&rsquo;t play
for money). I&rsquo;d hate to think that my presents
exerted a poor moral influence on my dear Godson.
Would you mind just dropping a hint as to what
kind of presents would be most acceptable? I have
never been in the habit of giving presents to men
and the kinds of presents some of my friends give
would not be very appropriate, it seems to me.
Silver match boxes and cigarette holders would not
be very useful, nor would silk socks with initials
embroidered on them be much better. Do you like
chocolate drops and poetry?</p>

<p><span class="rght3">Your affectionate Fairy Godmother,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">Polly Nelson.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The night nurse laughed outright at the close
of the letter and Stephen Scott reached out for
the packet from which she was extracting a third
blue envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going to make fun of them, you
can stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t making fun. I was just thinking
what funny presents girls do give men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so they do, but my little Godmother
gave me bully presents,&mdash;cigarettes to burn,
home-made molasses candy and beaten biscuit.
She had lots of imagination in the presents she
sent and the blessed child never did burden me
with a work-box but sent me a gross of safety-pins
that beat all the sewing kits on earth.
I don&rsquo;t believe you like my Godmother
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? Well, I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should like her because somehow you
remind me of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only in my mind&rsquo;s eye. I begged her for a
picture of herself but she has never sent it. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
has promised it, though. You see I got to answering
her letters in the same spirit in which she
wrote to me, only I was not quite so frank, I am
afraid. She told me everything about herself
while I told her only my thoughts. I never did
tell her I was not a homeless soldier of fortune.
She thinks I am absolutely friendless and dependent
on my pay as a private for my living.
Sometimes I wish I didn&rsquo;t have a sou&mdash;at least I
have felt that way&mdash;but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now I don&rsquo;t think it is so bad to have a
little tin,&rdquo; and he held one of the little stained
hands in his for a moment.</p>

<p>She gently withdrew it and opened a third letter.
This was full of hospital experiences and
so were all that followed. The tone of them became
more intimate and friendly. The desire to
serve was ever uppermost&mdash;just to get in the
War Zone and help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got awfully stuck on her, somehow,&rdquo; confessed
the man. &ldquo;She was so sweet and so girlish&mdash;I
did not say so for fear of scaring her off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
but I used to write her pretty warm ones, I am
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, honey, you must see that I am head
over heels in love with you. I oughtn&rsquo;t to be telling
it to you when I have written my little Godmother
that as soon as the war is over I am going
to find her and tell her the same thing. But,
somehow, I was loving her only on paper and in
my mind; but you&mdash;you&mdash;I love you with every
bit of my heart, soul and body.&rdquo; He caught her
hand and all of the poor little slim blue letters
slipped from the twine and scattered over the
floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the poor little letters!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Is
that all they mean to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, honey, they meant a lot to me and still
do, but they are just letters and you are&mdash;you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about the letters you wrote Miss
Polly Nelson? Are they just letters to her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
nothing more? Don&rsquo;t you think it is possible
that she may have treasured your letters, especially
the pretty warm ones, and be looking forward
to the end of the war with the same eagerness
that you have felt up to&mdash;say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The minute I laid eyes on you. At first I
used to dream maybe you were she, but I began
to feel that she must be much&mdash;younger&mdash;somehow,
than you. You are so capable, so mature in
a way. She is little more than a child and you
are a grown woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am twenty-one&mdash;but the war ages one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you look old&mdash;I just mean you
seem so sensible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Nelson didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that, I just mean she seemed
immature. But suppose you read the last letter.
And couldn&rsquo;t you do it with one hand and let me
hold the other?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; and the night nurse stooped
and gathered the scattered letters. Leaning over
may have accounted for the rosy hue that overspread
her countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly read her writing mighty easily.
I had a hard time at first. I think she writes a
rotten fist, although there is plenty of character
in it, dear little Godmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Do you think so? I wouldn&rsquo;t tell
her that if I were you&mdash;I mean that you think her
fist is rotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not, but begin, please, and say&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
you manage with one hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the night nurse was adamant and drew
herself up very primly and began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Godson:</span></p>

<p>I am afraid gratitude has got the better of
you. You must not feel that because a girl in
America has written you a pile of foolish letters
and sent you a few little paltry presents, you must
send her such very loverlike letters in return. I
am disappointed in you, Godson. I had an idea
that you were steadier. Just suppose I were a designing
female who was going to hold you up and
drag you through the wounded-affections court?
There is quite enough in your last two letters to
justify such a proceeding. It may be only your
poverty that will restrain me. In the first place,
you don&rsquo;t know me from Adam or rather Eve. I
may be a Fairy Godmother with a crooked back
and a black cat, who prefers a broom-stick to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
limousine; I may have a hare-lip and a mean disposition;
I may write vers libre and believe in dress
reform. In fact I am a pig in a poke and you are a
very foolish person to think you want to carry me
off without ever looking at me. I won&rsquo;t say that I
don&rsquo;t want to see you and know you, because I do.
I have been very honest with you in my letters because,
as I told you once, it has seemed almost like
keeping a diary to write to you, and I think a person
who is not honest in a diary is as bad as the
person who cheats at solitaire. When the war is
over if you want to look me up you will find me in
Louisville, Kentucky. When you do find me, I
want you to be nothing but my Godson. You may
not like me a bit and I may find you unbearable,&mdash;somehow,
I don&rsquo;t believe I shall, though. I do hope
you will like me, too. One thing I promise&mdash;that
is, not to fall in love with anyone else until I have
looked you over. And you&mdash;I fancy you see no females
to fall in love with.</p>

<p>I never let myself think about your getting
killed. As Fairy Godmother I cast a spell about
you to protect you. There are times when I almost
wish you could be safely wounded. Those
are the times when I doubt the efficacy of my
prayers and the powers of my fairy gifts.</p>

<p>And now for the news: I am going to the front!
I have worked it by strategy. A girl I know has
had all her papers made out ready to join the Red
Cross nurses, and now at the last minute her young
man has stepped in and persuaded her to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
him instead. I have cajoled the papers from her
and am leaving in a few hours. Aunt Sally and
Cousin Kate, Uncle Bruce and Cousin Maria are
half demented. They don&rsquo;t know how I worked it
or I am sure they would have the law on me for
perjury. I am free, white, and twenty-one now, and
they could control me in no other way. Good-by,
Godson! I wonder if we will meet somewhere in
France. I will write you when I can, but I am
afraid I shall not be able to send any more presents
for a while.</p>

<p><span class="rght3">Your affectionate Godmother.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you hate and despise me for telling
you what I did just now? You see she says
she will at least not fall in love with anyone else
until she looks me over, and think what I have
done! What must I do? I am going to try not
to tell you I love you any more until that other
girl knows what a blackguard I am, but you must
understand all the time that I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand nothing, Mr. Stephen Scott.
I am simply the night nurse in the convalescent
ward and you have asked me to read some letters
to you, and I have read them; and now it is my
duty to forget what is in them, and I am going to
do it,&mdash;I have done it. All I can say is that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
might give Miss Polly Nelson the chance to find
someone else she likes better than she does you
before you are so quick to take for granted she
will stick to her bargain, too. If there is any
jilting going on, we Southern girls rather prefer
to be the jilters than the jiltees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say jilting! It isn&rsquo;t fair. Please be
good to me! I am so miserable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night nurse smiled in spite of herself and
felt his pulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now! Just as I thought! You have
worked yourself up into an abnormal pulse and I
shall have to start a chart on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abnormal nothing! How is a fellow&rsquo;s pulse
to remain normal when you put your dear little
fingers on his wrist? But I forgot! I am not
going to make love to you until I can let my Godmother
know. Maybe she has met some grand
English Tommy by this time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And then
he groaned aloud and cried: &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want
her to do that, either!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I&rsquo;m not in love with two girls,&rdquo; he
thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The night nurse sat quietly down to her charts
after having gone the rounds of her ward. All
was quiet. The convalescent soldiers were sleeping
peacefully, dreaming of home, she hoped.
Scott stirred restlessly now and then. He could
not sleep but watched the busy little stained hand
of the night nurse as it glided rapidly over the
charts. She had no light but that of a guttering
candle, carefully shaded from her patients&rsquo; eyes,
but Scott could see her well-poised head and fine
profile as she bent over her writing. How lovely
she was! Would she ever listen to him? How
she stood up for her sex,&mdash;and still she did not
exactly repulse him. What a strange name for
a girl like that to have! Grubb! It was preposterous.
Indeed, he felt it his duty to make
her change that name as soon as possible. Polly
Nelson is a pretty name&mdash;dear little Godmother!
Would she despise him, too, like this other girl?
But did this other one despise him?</p>

<p>The night nurse made her rounds again and
then left the ward for a moment. When she returned,
she came to the American&rsquo;s bedside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A letter has just come for you, Mr. Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me? Splendid! Will you read it to
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you cannot possibly see to do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might, but I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in the same rotten fist of those I read
you to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Fairy Godmother! I&mdash;I&mdash;believe I can
see to read that myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She handed him the letter. Her hand was
trembling a little and so was his. She brought
the guttering candle and he opened his letter.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="rght2"><cite>Somewhere in France.</cite></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Godson:</span></p>

<p>I have always been so frank with you that I
feel I must make a confession. I promised you in
my last letter, the one I wrote just before I left
home, that I would not fall in love with anyone
until after the war, when you were to present yourself
in Louisville and we were to view each other
for the first time. Dear Godson&mdash;&mdash; I have not
kept my word. They say a man falls in love with
his nurse often because of the feeling he has for
his mother. She makes it seem as though he were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a little child again. I reckon a nurse falls in love
with her patient because he seems so like a little
boy. She loves him first because of the maternal
instinct. Be that as it may, I am in love with one
of my patients. I tell you this fearing you may
be wounded and you may fall in the hands of a
cap and apron, and from a feeling of noblesse
oblige you may not grasp the happiness within your
reach.</p>

<p>God bless you, my dear Godson!</p>

<p><span class="rght3">Always,</span><br />
<span class="rght1">Your Fairy Godmother.</span><br />
</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;He is an American.<br /></p>
</div>

<p>A great tear rolled down the scarred cheek of
the young soldier and splashed on the signature.
Then something happened that made him sit up
very straight in his cot and stretch out a shaking
hand for the night nurse. She was by his side in
a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! Look! The ink is not dry yet. See
where that tear dropped! Dry ink would not
float off like that!&rdquo; He turned the sheet over.
It was a chart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you&mdash;little Fairy Godmother!
Who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one American in my ward.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said your name was Grubb!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my official name. Mary Grubb was
the girl whose place I got with the Red Cross.
Do you know, you hurt my feelings terribly when
you said my fist was rotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Stephen Scott, holding the little stained
and roughened hand in his, wondered that he ever
could have made such a break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, you are just one girl, after all!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>But the night nurse wished that there were two
of her for a while at least: one to stay by the bedside
of the convalescent American and one to
make out the charts that must be got ready for
the morning rounds of the surgeon in charge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE CRITICS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said Billie, rapping for order as the
girls began all at once to say what they thought
of &ldquo;Fairy Godmothers Wanted.&rdquo; The one with
the burning plot began rattling her paper in
preparation of the turn she hoped for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First general impressions are in order! One
at a time, please! You, Miss Oldham, you tell
us how it strikes you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasing on the whole, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come to the &lsquo;buts&rsquo; later,&rdquo; was the stern
mandate of the chairman of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Lilian Swift, you next!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too long!&rdquo; from the blunt Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea! I think it was just sweet,&rdquo; from
the gentle Alabamian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got kind of mixed in the middle and
couldn&rsquo;t tell which was the nurse and which Polly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Nelson,&rdquo; declared one who had evidently gone off
into a cataleptic fit, no doubt dreaming of a story
she meant to write some day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never, never could love a man who had deceived
me,&rdquo; sighed the sentimental one with big
eyes and a little mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personal predilections not valuable as criticism,&rdquo;
said Billie sternly.</p>

<p>Many and various were the opinions expressed.
Molly diligently and meekly took notes, agreeing
heartily with the ones who thought it was too
long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where must I cut it?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut out all the letters!&rdquo; suggested Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could she? It is all letters,&rdquo; asked
Billie, whose chair was becoming a burden as she
felt she must get into the discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut &rsquo;em, anyhow. Letters in fiction are no
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! How about the early English
novelists?&rdquo; asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead! Dead! All of them dead!&rdquo; stormed
Lilian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how about Mary Roberts Rinehart and
Booth Tarkington and lots of others? Daddy
Longlegs is all letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the samey, it is a poor stunt,&rdquo; insisted the
intrepid Lilian. &ldquo;I call it a lazy way to get
your idea over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right, but the point is: did
I get my idea over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We-ll, yes,&mdash;but they tell me editors don&rsquo;t
like letter form of fiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly none of them have liked this,&rdquo;
sighed Molly, who had devoutly hoped her little
story would sell. The money she made herself
was very delightful to receive and more delightful
to spend. A professor&rsquo;s salary can as a rule
stand a good deal of supplementing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the plot, now?&rdquo; asked Billie,
having finished with the general impression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weak!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plausible!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Original!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bromidic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Involved!&rdquo; were the verdicts. The matter
was thoroughly threshed out, Billie with difficulty
keeping order. Nance was called on for
the &ldquo;but&rdquo; that she had been left holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The plot is slight but certainly original in its
way. The letters are too long, longer than a
Godmother would be apt to write, I think. The
story could be cut to three thousand words, I believe,
to its advantage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already cut out about fifteen hundred
words,&rdquo; wailed Molly. &ldquo;The first writing was
lots longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; breathed the one eager for a hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the characterization! Don&rsquo;t all
speak at once, but one at a time tell what you
think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you mean to make Polly so silly?&rdquo; asked
Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps!&rdquo; faltered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course if you meant to, why then your
characterization is perfect.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly! Why, she is dear,&rdquo; declared the girl
from Alabama. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her having to
nurse that black man, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too many points of view!&rdquo; suddenly blurted
out a member who had hitherto kept perfectly
silent, but she had been eagerly scanning a paper
whereon was written the requisites for a short
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; meekly began Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The point of view must either be that of the
author solely or one of the characters,&rdquo; asserted
the knowing one. &ldquo;Why, you even let us know
how the Bedouin feels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped the poor author. &ldquo;I think you
would limit the story teller too much if you eliminated
such things as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what the correspondence course
says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare us!&rdquo; cried the club in a chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate all these cut and dried rules!&rdquo; cried
Billie. &ldquo;It would take all the spice out of literature
if we stuck to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; answered Lilian. &ldquo;We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
not making literature but trying to sell our stuff.
Persons who have arrived can write any old way.
They can start off with the climax and end up
with an introduction and their things go, but I&rsquo;ll
bet you my hat that you will not find a single
story by a new writer that does not have to toe the
mark drawn by the teachers of short story writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which hat?&rdquo; teased Billie. &ldquo;The one you
put on for Great-aunt Gertrude? If it is that
one, I won&rsquo;t bet. I wouldn&rsquo;t read a short story
by a new writer for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To return to my story,&rdquo; pleaded Molly, &ldquo;do
you think if I rewrite it, leave out the letters,
strengthen the plot a bit and make Polly a little
wiser that I might sell it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; encouraged Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the black man&mdash;please cut him out! I
can&rsquo;t bear to think of him,&rdquo; from the girl from
Alabama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dialogue,&mdash;how about it?&rdquo; asked the chairman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good, but a little stilted,&rdquo; was the verdict
of several critics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are all of you simply horrid!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mary Neil, who had been silent and
sullen through the whole evening. &ldquo;I think it is
the best story that has been read all year and I
believe you are just jealous to tear it to pieces
this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do hope we haven&rsquo;t hurt your feelings,
Mrs. Green,&rdquo; cried the girl who was taking the
correspondence course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt my feelings! The very idea! I read
my story to get help from you and not praise. I
am going to think over what you have said and do
my best to correct the faults, if I come to the conclusion
you are right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have a hard time doing what
everybody says,&rdquo; laughed Nance, &ldquo;as no two
have agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can pick and choose among so many
opinions,&rdquo; said Molly, putting her manuscript
back in its big envelope. &ldquo;I might do as my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
mother did when she got the opinion of two physicians
on the diet she was to have: she simply took
from each man the advice that best suited her
taste and between the two managed to be very
well fed, and, strange to say, got well of her malady
under the composite treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; said the girl with the burning plot,
rattling her manuscript audibly so that the hardhearted
Billie must perforce recognize her and
give her the floor.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>&ldquo;I HAD A LITTLE HUSBAND NO BIGGER THAN MY
THUMB&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Aunt Nance, what&rsquo;s the use you ain&rsquo;t got
no husband an&rsquo; baby children?&rdquo; Mildred always
said use instead of reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of reasons!&rdquo; answered Nance, smiling
at her little companion. Mildred had moved
herself and all her belongings into the guest-chamber.
Her mother had at first objected, but
when she found it made Nance happy to have the
child with her, she gave her consent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no husbands come along wantin&rsquo; you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is one of the reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make Dodo marry you when he
gets some teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, darling! Dodo would make a
dear little husband.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dodo wouldn&rsquo;t never say nothin&rsquo; mean to
you. He&rsquo;s got more disposition than any baby
in the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nance, trying to
count the stitches as she neatly turned the heel of
the grey sock she was knitting. Nance was always
knitting in those days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cose if I kin get you a husband a little teensy
weensy bit taller than Dodo, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! But Dodo will grow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll make out to shrink up some.
Katy kin shrink you. My muvver said Katy
kin shrink up anything. She done shrinked up
Dodo&rsquo;s little shirts jes&rsquo; big enough for my dolly.
I&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; crazy &rsquo;bout Katy. I&rsquo;m gonter ask her kin
she shrink you up no bigger&rsquo;n Dodo an&rsquo; then
won&rsquo;t you be cunning? You can look jes&rsquo; like
you look now only teensy weensy little. Your
little feet&rsquo;ll be so long, not great big ones like
mine, an&rsquo; your little hands will be &rsquo;bout as big as
my little fingers an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;you kin knit little bits
of baby socks an&rsquo; I kin take you out ridin&rsquo; in my
little doll-baby carriage, all tucked in nice.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But then I&rsquo;ll be too little to marry Dodo.
You won&rsquo;t trust your doll to Dodo, and if I&rsquo;m so
teensy maybe he might break me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I guess Katy&rsquo;ll have to stretch
you some. She done stretched the shirt mos&rsquo; a
mile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say to taking a little walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say: &lsquo;Glory be!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what Kizzie, our
cook, says when she&rsquo;s happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we take Dodo out in his carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can put my dolly in, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dodo was awake and pleased to be included in
this outing, if gurglings and splutterings were an
indication of happiness. He and the doll were
tucked safely in. Katy, who had been longing
for the time to come when she could scrub the
nursery, was delighted to be relieved of her
charge for the time being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall we walk?&rdquo; asked Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down by the lake! My dolly ain&rsquo;t never
seed the lake yet. They&rsquo;s a little blue boat down
there what my papa, the &rsquo;fessor, done say he
gonter set sail in some day. He say he gonter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
go way out in the middle of the lake where th&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t no little girls with curls to come tickle his
nose in the morning. My papa is kind and good,
but he sho&rsquo; do hate to have his nose tickled with
curls early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lake! How many memories it brought
back to Nance! The blue boat might be the
same one in which Judy Kean had her memorable
midnight jaunt, or was it a canoe? Nance smiled
at the picture that arose in her mind&rsquo;s eye. It
was their Junior year and Judy had gone off in a
fit of jealousy and rage, and when she came to
herself she was out in the middle of the lake while
Molly and Nance rowed frantically after her.
What a time they had covering their tracks to
keep Judy from being found out and perhaps
even expelled! Nance laughed aloud.</p>

<p>The sun was warm on that day in late March,
almost like a southern sun. Dodo, lazy baby,
had slipped from his sitting posture and lay flat
on his back. He had the same characteristics as
Mildred&rsquo;s doll baby: the moment he lay down his
eyes closed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a sleepy husband I have got!&rdquo;
cried Nance. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s camp out here, darling. I
brought my knitting and while my little husband
sleeps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my doll baby, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can play in that nice clean sand. Don&rsquo;t
go too close to the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a stretch of beach at that side of
the lake where a small pier had been built for
a boat-landing. The sand was fine and
white, a most delectable medium for houses
or pies, whatever the young sculptor wished to
create.</p>

<p>Nance seated herself on a nice warm rock while
her little companion busied herself collecting
pebbles for the castle she contemplated building.
The sock grew under the girl&rsquo;s skillful fingers
while her thoughts were miles away from the
poor soldier whose foot it was destined to cover.
Dodo snoozed peacefully and no doubt the doll
did, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! Look! Aunt Nance, I&rsquo;ve done found
some kitty flowers!&rdquo; cried Mildred, rushing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Nance with a switch of willow catkins she had
found growing near the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;I had a little pussy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her coat was silver grey.<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>sang Nance. &ldquo;Now let me teach you that nice
verse so you can say it to your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mildred obediently learned the poetry in so
short a time that her teacher marveled at her
cleverness and good memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, darling, you mustn&rsquo;t go quite so close
to the water again. Aunt Nance will gather a
big armful of the pussy-willows to take back to
Mother, but you might get your little tootsies wet
if you go too close to the edge. Then I&rsquo;ll have
to put you in the carriage with my husband and
run home every step of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mildred trotted off with assurances of caution.
Nance settled herself to her knitting and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
thoughts. What a boon this universal knitting
has become to women who want to think and be
busy at the same time! The girl&rsquo;s thoughts were
centered on herself. What was she to do with
her life? The desire to teach had left her with
the years she had spent nursing her father and
mother. United States was on the verge of war&mdash;any
moment it might be declared. That would
mean the women of the land would be in demand
just as they had been in Europe. There
would be work to do, but what was her share to
be?</p>

<p>This little breathing time with Molly was very
sweet, but it could not go on forever. The time
would come when she must take up life again.
Her unruly thoughts would dwell on how different
things would have been had Andy McLean
not shown himself so unreasonable. She might
have gone to the front with him. There was
work in the hospitals in France for others besides
trained nurses, lots of work! Cooking, cleaning,
sewing, peeling potatoes, scrubbing floors&mdash;nothing
was too menial for her. It would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sweet to work near Andy, shoulder to shoulder in
spirit even if he would happen to be the surgeon
in charge and she a poor scrub girl. She might
have been taking care of some of the war orphans.
Minding little babies was her long suit, it seemed.
A big tear gathered and spilled on the toe of the
sock that was being so neatly finished off.</p>

<p>A shrill scream broke on the still air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-sinkin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m a-sinkin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mildred!&rdquo; cried Nance, jumping to her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, nurse, I&rsquo;ll go after her,&rdquo; said a
stern voice from behind her. &ldquo;You had better
look after your other charge,&rdquo; in a tone which
made no attempt to veil its sarcasm.</p>

<p>Dodo had awakened and was sitting up in the
carriage reaching for the willow catkins. His
position was precarious, as one more inch might
have sent him headlong in the sand.</p>

<p>Nance dropped her knitting and grabbed the
venturesome baby while the stern voice materialized
into a tall grey figure with sandy hair who
ran towards the water&rsquo;s edge, skinning out of his
coat and vest as he ran and in some miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
way also divesting himself of his shoes. His hat
he had already hurled at Nance&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>Mildred had walked out on the little pier and
decided that she would get in the pretty blue boat
that her father considered such a safe refuge
from tickling curls. It was bobbing about most
invitingly in easy stepping distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Aunt Nance be &rsquo;stonished?&rdquo; the child
had said to herself. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gonter holler out:
&lsquo;M-i-i-l-dred! Where you Mi&mdash;ldred baby?&rsquo;
an&rsquo; I gonter lay low an&rsquo; keep on a-sayin&rsquo;
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put out her little foot and set it firmly on
the bow of the boat that was almost grazing the
edge of the landing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My legs is a-gettin&rsquo; mos&rsquo; long enough to step
up to the moon an&rsquo; stars,&rdquo; she boasted.</p>

<p>But how strangely boats behaved! This one
did not stay still as she had expected but ran
away from her. Her legs had not grown nearly
so long as she had thought and they refused to
grow another bit. The boat got farther and
farther away and the horrid little pier seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
be moving, too, and in the opposite direction.
The time came when Mildred must choose between
land and water. She decided to stay on
shore and with a mighty effort jerked her little
foot from the unsteady blue boat. Three years
going on four is not a period of great equilibrium.
Fate took matters out of Mildred&rsquo;s hands
and kersplash! she went in the cold waters of the
lake. It was not very deep so close to the shore,
but neither was the little girl so very tall. By
standing on her tiptoes she might have managed
to keep her inquisitive nose out of the water,
but the naughty blue boat came swinging back
to her rescue and she clutched first the painter
and then the side of the boat, screaming lustily
as she clung.</p>

<p>The grey figure with the sandy hair ran lightly
along the pier and with one swoop gathered the
child up into his arms. He might have saved
himself the trouble of taking off his coat and
shoes, but he had seen the child as she fell in the
water and did not know what would be required
of him as life saver. Mildred was sobbing dolefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as she buried her wet curls in the neck of
her rescuer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your nurse should have looked after you,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had her husband to &rsquo;tend to,&rdquo; said Mildred,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I was a-keepin&rsquo; keer of myself. &rsquo;Sides
she ain&rsquo;t my nurse but my &rsquo;loved aunty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! And who may you be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mildred Carbuncle Green.&rdquo; The family
name of Molly&rsquo;s mother, which was Carmichael,
was thus perverted by this scion of the race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your aunt&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked the young
man as he picked up his discarded coat and
wrapped it around his burden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Aunt Nance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance Oldham!&rdquo; and he almost dropped little
Mildred. &ldquo;And you say she was busy with
her husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessir! He keeps her busy mos&rsquo; of the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rescue and this conversation had taken but
a moment. In the meantime, poor Nance had
shoved her little husband back in the carriage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was rapidly wheeling him towards the scene of
disaster.</p>

<p>She had recognized Andy McLean in the tall
grey figure and sandy hair. The moment he had
spoken to her so sternly she had known it was he.
At that moment she envied no creature in the
world so much as an ostrich. If she could only
bury her head in the sand. Why should Fate
be so cruel to her? Why should Andy McLean
come back on her horizon at that moment when
she was neglecting her duty? But then, she reflected,
if he had not come back at that psychological
moment either Mildred would have
drowned or Dodo broken his neck. She could
not have rescued both of them at once. Indeed,
both of them might have been killed! The fact
that the water was shallow and Mildred could
have walked out of it was no comfort to Nance,
nor did it allay her suffering and self-reproaches
in the least to know that almost every baby that
has grown to manhood has at one time or another
fallen out of his carriage or bed, down the steps
or even out of the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Andy McLean, too, was going through some
uncomfortable moments as he held the dripping
child close in his arms and made his way across
the beach to Nance. There had never been a
moment since he and Nance had parted that he
had not regretted his hasty words; but what good
were regrets? Nance could not have cared for
him or she would have felt that at her father&rsquo;s
death he was the person to whom she must turn
instead of that Dr. Flint. As far as he could see,
there was no reason under Heaven why Nance
should not have married him immediately. He
knew nothing of her mother&rsquo;s determination to
give up her public life nor of her decision to remain
at home for Nance to nurse. He had not
yet learned of Mrs. Oldham&rsquo;s death, as he had
arrived at Wellington only the evening before,
and Mrs. McLean, with a wisdom sometimes
granted mothers, had not mentioned Nance&rsquo;s
name to him, much less the fact that she was
even then visiting the Greens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! and so engrossed with her husband
that she let little children entrusted to her care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fall in the water and almost fall out of baby carriages!
But where is the&mdash;the&mdash;cad?&rdquo; was what
Andy was thinking as he approached the frantic
Nance, who was pushing the carriage as for dear
life through the heavy sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mildred! Mildred! You promised not to
go near the water&rsquo;s edge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never went near it but jes&rsquo; ran out on the
little wooden street. I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be
naughty. I knowed I might get my feet wet
down by the edge so I walked on the planks. I
never done nothin&rsquo; nor nothin&rsquo;! &rsquo;Twas the bad
little blue boat what wobbled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance and Andy both laughed at the amusing
child. The laugh made matters easier for them.</p>

<p>Brown eyes looked into blue and then such a
blush o&rsquo;erspread their countenances that a day&rsquo;s
fishing under a summer sun could not have accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better put her in the carriage&mdash;it
is warm there and I can carry Dodo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will keep her wrapped in my coat.
That will be better.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you might be cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! I never catch cold,&rdquo; shortly.</p>

<p>Nance remembered otherwise, but there was
nothing to do but turn and wheel the baby back
to the house on the campus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;you must think&mdash;I know I was careless
to let such an accident happen to my
charges. I have no excuse&mdash;I was just thinking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About your husband, I fancy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Nance&rsquo;s cheeks were crimson, remembering
only too well what her thoughts had been
as she sat in the sand knitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mildred told me about him,&rdquo; said Andy
grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she?&rdquo; laughed Nance, thinking that
Andy was speaking of Dodo, of course. &ldquo;He is
a darling husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; They walked on in silence, Andy
taking great strides with Mildred clasped closely
in his arms, while Nance wheeled the baby carriage,
almost running to keep up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to call you,&rdquo; said Andy
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me? Why, call me Nance! Why not?
My name is still Nance no matter what has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband! Is it Flint?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andy McLean, you are a fool! There is no
other word for you!&rdquo; and Nance grabbed Dodo
from his carriage and ran up the steps, thankful
that they had arrived at the Square Deal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If not Flint, who?&rdquo; muttered Andy under
his breath. &ldquo;I am going to stay here until I find
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was not at home to receive her wet
daughter. Nance and Katy rubbed her down
and dressed her while Andy waited miserably in
the library. Why had his mother not warned
him that Nance Oldham was in Wellington?
They had had a long talk and she had told him
news of all their old friends. Molly and Edwin
had been mentioned again and again but the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that they had a guest had been kept dark. He
had never talked to his mother about his break
with Nance. A certain reticence in his make-up
withheld him. Many times he had longed to put
his head in her lap and tell her all about it.</p>

<p>A great intimacy existed between Mrs. McLean
and this only child, but instead of his being like
a daughter to her, as is the case sometimes
with a woman and an only child when that child
happens to be a son, this worthy mother had adjusted
herself more into the relationship of an
elder brother to Andy. There were few if any
subjects they could not discuss together, but
somehow he could not bring himself to tell her
of Nance. She had known they were engaged&mdash;that
was easy to tell, and she knew the engagement
was no more&mdash;that was all. Mrs. McLean
bided her time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are young yet,&rdquo; she had said to her
husband. &ldquo;Some misunderstanding has come up,
but if they are really meant for one another it
will be explained away. If they can&rsquo;t forgive,
then they are not suited for mating.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The good woman had been delighted beyond
measure that Nance should be in Wellington
while her son was on his farewell visit to her, and
she had devoutly prayed that they might meet by
chance, just as they had. Of course she had not
stipulated in her prayers that Andy should mistake
Nance for the Greens&rsquo; nurse and reprimand
her for carelessness; and then fish Mildred out
of the water; and get Dodo and the hated Dr.
Flint hopelessly mixed, and be called a fool for
his blunder!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>NANCE PACKS HER TRUNK</small></h2>


<p>Molly, coming in hurriedly from her labors
at the French War Relief rooms where she had
been engaged in making surgical dressings until
her back ached so that she had more sympathy
for the poor wounded than ever, if possible,
found young Dr. McLean cooling his heels and
drying his coat by her library fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andy! I am so glad to see you!&rdquo; she cried,
grasping both of his hands. &ldquo;When did you
come? Did you know Nance Oldham is with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have seen her,&rdquo; grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you know of her trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trouble! I shouldn&rsquo;t call it that. She evidently
does not consider it in that light.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Andy McLean, how can you say such a
thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I formed my opinions from the evidence
of my own eyes. In fact, she told me with
her own lips that she was contented; if not in so
many words, at least she gave me that impression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resigned, of course! That is Nance&rsquo;s way,
but she is very sad and lonesome for all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lonesome! Ye Gods, how many does she
want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Andy, but you are talking like a
goose,&rdquo; declared Molly, irritated in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, madam,&rdquo; he said, bowing low.
&ldquo;Your guest has just called me a fool and now
you call me a goose. I bid you good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, indeed! Andy McLean, sit down
here and let me send for your father. I believe
my soul you are in a fever or something.&rdquo; Molly
pushed him down in a chair near the fire.
&ldquo;Why, Andy, your coat is damp! Where have
you been?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>She drew a chair by him and seated herself,
looking anxiously into his flushed face. Andy
laughed in a hard tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right, but don&rsquo;t send for Father.
I got my coat wet in a perfectly sane way,
but perhaps you had better find out about that
from Mrs. Fl&mdash;Nance&mdash;I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy balked at that name of Mrs. Flint and
then, besides, Nance had called him a fool when
he had hinted at the doctor&rsquo;s being the happy
man. At this juncture little Mildred came running
into the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mumsy! Mumsy! Is you heard &rsquo;bout me
an&rsquo; the blue boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, darling! But what makes your curls so
wet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was that baddest blue boat. It
wouldn&rsquo;t stay still &rsquo;til I got in&mdash;it jes&rsquo; moved and
moved&mdash;an&rsquo; the little wooden street, it moved an&rsquo;
moved an&rsquo; I went kerblim! kersplash!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the lake! Oh, Mildred! I know you
didn&rsquo;t mind Aunt Nance. Are you cold? Did
Aunt Nance get wet? Where is Dodo?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;fuses me with so many ain&rsquo;t&rsquo;s an&rsquo; do&rsquo;s
and didn&rsquo;t&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell me all about it,&rdquo; said the doting
mother, trying to compose herself as she gathered
the first-born in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, me&rsquo;n&rsquo; Aunt Nance we went
a-walkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; we tooked Dodo along an&rsquo; my dolly,
an&rsquo; Aunt Nance she says that one use she ain&rsquo;t
got no husband is &rsquo;cause don&rsquo;t no husband want
her, an&rsquo; I done tol&rsquo; her that if Katy kin shrink her
up some that Dodo kin be her husband. You
see, Mumsy, I been a-feelin&rsquo; sorry for Aunt
Nance ever since that time I mos&rsquo; went to sleep
in her lap an&rsquo; she talked about a beau lover what
got to fightin&rsquo; with her an&rsquo; she hit him back. She
wetted my ear all up with her tears. I jes&rsquo; done
thunk somethin&rsquo;!&rdquo; the child exclaimed, getting
out of her mother&rsquo;s lap and peering curiously into
Andy&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Is you the Andy what talked so
crule to my Aunt Nance? &rsquo;Cause if you is, I&rsquo;m
sorry you done pulled me out&rsquo;n the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mildred! Mildred!&rdquo; admonished Molly, but
in her heart of hearts she knew that what the enfant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
terrible was saying to the young doctor was
no doubt of a very salutary nature. He needed
a good talking to and he was getting it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the one,&rdquo; said Andy meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when Dodo grows up to be big enough
he is goin&rsquo; to&mdash;to&mdash;cut you up in little pieces.
He&rsquo;s growin&rsquo; up fast an&rsquo; bein&rsquo; a husband is
makin&rsquo; him cut his teeth early&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly Brown!&rdquo; interrupted Andy McLean
eagerly. &ldquo;Is Nance not married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! The idea, Andy! Of course not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is! She&rsquo;s married to Dodo Green.
I married &rsquo;em this morning,&rdquo; declared Mildred
defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh! I see it all now!&rdquo; laughed Molly
hysterically. &ldquo;You were talking about her
mythical marriage while I was speaking of her
mother&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother dead? I had not heard a word
of it. Strange that so important a woman as
Mrs. Oldham should have died without my seeing
it mentioned in the paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Oldham dropped out of public life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
two years ago, when her husband died, in fact.
Nance had hardly rested from the long siege of
nursing her father before she began on her
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy bowed his sandy-haired head in his hands
and groaned:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool! Fool! Every kind of fool and goose
you and Nance choose to call me,&mdash;fool and
knave! Bad-tempered brute! Jealous idiot!
Oh, Molly, please call Nance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Nance had hurled her &ldquo;fool&rdquo; at Andy&rsquo;s
sandy head, she flew up-stairs, determined never
to speak to him again. She longed for a few
quiet moments in her own room, but Mildred
must be rubbed down and dressed before she
could seek retirement. She was sure he would
leave the house immediately. His coat was wet
and no doubt his vest and shirt, too, after having
carried the dripping child such a distance. Of
course he would not want to call on the Greens
while she was in the house. The girl bitterly regretted
having timed her visit so unfortunately.
The Greens and McLeans were very intimate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and would perforce see each other often. She
hated to be a wet blanket&mdash;a skeleton at the feast.
She determined to pack her trunk and go on a
promised visit to an old college friend then living
in New York. Molly would object, she knew,
but it was surely best for all of them that she
should take herself off for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Nance was always an orderly person and packing
a trunk with her was a very simple matter.
She began in her usual systematic way and had
already folded her dresses neatly in the trays and
was emptying the bureau drawers when Molly&rsquo;s
voice was heard calling her from the lower
hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance! Oh, Nance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sounded quite excited. No doubt she had
just been informed of Mildred&rsquo;s accident and
wanted to hear the details of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; called Nance, hurrying down the
steps. &ldquo;Oh, Molly, what do you think of me for
taking out the children and almost drowning Mildred?
And while that was going on, little Dodo
came within an ace of tumbling out of the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
on his precious sleepy head! You will
never trust them with me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Mildred is old enough not to try
to get in boats alone, and as for Dodo, Aunt
Mary always said: &lsquo;Whin chilluns grows up
&rsquo;thout ever gittin&rsquo; a tumble, they is sho&rsquo; to be
idjits.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my real duty was to let him tumble,&rdquo;
laughed Nance. &ldquo;What do you want with
me, honey? I am very busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not too busy to come in and talk with me a
little while,&rdquo; insisted the wily Molly, putting her
arm around her friend&rsquo;s waist and leading her to
the library door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do want to talk to you a moment,&rdquo; agreed
Nance. &ldquo;Molly, I am going away for a few
weeks.&rdquo; They had reached the door, which was
ajar, and Andy, ensconced in the sleepy-hollow
chair dear to the professor&rsquo;s bones, could plainly
hear the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going away! You are going to do no such
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must. There is no use in asking me why&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
know why&mdash;&mdash; It is too hard for me and
there is no use in pretending it is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have begun to pack and I will go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of the hospitable protestations characteristic
of Molly, that young housewife said not a
word, but giving her friend a little push towards
the fireplace, she grabbed up Mildred and rushed
from the room, closing the door after her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>A DAMP COAT</small></h2>


<p>Andy undoubled himself with alacrity and
sprang from the sleepy-hollow chair. His stern
face was softened and filled with a boyish eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance! Can&rsquo;t you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Dr. McLean, I did not know
you were still here,&rdquo; and Nance turned to leave
the room.</p>

<p>Andy with long strides reached the door first
and with his back against it held out beseeching
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here and am going to stay
here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not! Please let me pass.&rdquo;
Nance was filled with a righteous indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
against Molly at having played this trick on
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, I must tell you what a fool I
have been&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not necessary. I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy laughed. Nance had a laconic way of
putting things that always tickled his humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you sound like yourself, honey, but oh,
please act like yourself! The real Nance Oldham
could not be so cruel as to go off without letting
me explain&mdash;I have no excuse&mdash;there could
be none for my blind rage and jealousy&mdash;none
unless loving you too hard could be called one.
Will you listen to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to unless I stop up my ears, since
you stop up the doorway.&rdquo; Nance was very pale
and trembling. Two years of suffering could
not be done away with in a moment and the girl
had surely suffered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we sit down and let me tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy eagerly directed Nance to the sofa, but
she sedately seated herself in a small isolated sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
rocker. Andy accepted the amendment and
placed his chair as near to hers as the frigid atmosphere
around her permitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I explain I must apologize. I would
have done it the very day after that awful row we
had, the very moment after it, if I had not
thought you hated me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I am going to apologize and explain,
whether you hate me or not. I could do it
lots better if you would let me hold your hand
while I am doing it,&rdquo; but Nance drew Molly&rsquo;s
knitting from a bag hung on the back of the chair
and declared her hands were otherwise occupied.
Molly had reached the purling end of a sleeveless
sweater and no doubt would be glad of Nance&rsquo;s
expert assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nance, there never has been any other woman
in my life but you, you and my mother. You
know perfectly well from the time I met you,
when I was at Exmoor College and you were
here at Wellington, that you were the only girl
in the world for me. I had a kind of notion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
my fool brain that I was going to be the only man
in the world for you. When we were engaged I
thought I was, but when I realized that Dr. Flint
was paying you such devoted attention, at your
home constantly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s physician!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&mdash;but, honey, you see you were
way up there in Vermont and I was down in New
York and I was hungry for you all the time, and
when your father died I thought you would pick
right up and come to me&mdash;I knew nothing of
your mother&rsquo;s determination to stay with you&mdash;nothing
of her illness&mdash;nothing but that you were
staying in the same town with Flint and I must
go back to New York. You did not tell
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly, after the way you raged and
tore! I felt if you could rage that way we had
better separate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, I&rsquo;ll never rage that way again&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
learned my lesson. Can&rsquo;t you forgive
me?&rdquo; Nance was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you just as much as I always did,&mdash;more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in fact. When little Mildred Green told
me you had let her fall in the water because you
were so busy with your husband, I wanted to die
that minute. Of course I thought it was Flint.
How could I know the child was playing a game
with you? Nance, do you hate me as much as
you did that terrible day two years ago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Nance&rsquo;s answer was very low but
Andy heard it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there is no use in saying any
more,&rdquo; he sprang to his feet, his face grey with
misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hate you then at all&mdash;nor do I now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nance, don&rsquo;t tease me! Can you forgive
me?&rdquo; and poor Andy sank on his knees and
bowed his head on her knees.</p>

<p>Nance&rsquo;s arms were around him in a moment.
She hugged his sandy head to her bosom with one
hand and patted his back with the other while he
gave a great sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andy McLean, you are still wringing wet.
Get up from here this minute and take off that
coat and let me dry it! And your shirt is damp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
too! My, what a boy! Here, sit right close to
the fire and dry that wet sleeve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy meekly submitted in a daze. Nance&rsquo;s
motherly attitude and sudden melting were too
much for him. The coat was hung by the fire to
dry while the young doctor stood helplessly by in
his shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Andy, I&rsquo;m going to apologize to
you and ask you to forgive me,&rdquo; declared Nance,
stoutly trying to go on with her knitting.</p>

<p>But Andy firmly took it from her and possessed
himself of those busy hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was worse than you&mdash;when you said those
hard things to me they hurt like fury&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t
know how they did hurt, but I did, and I should
not have done the same thing to you. I said
worse things to you than you did to me,&mdash;at least
I tried to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did pretty well,&rdquo; said Andy whimsically,
pressing one of the imprisoned hands to his
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Flint did want to marry me; I guess he
still does, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what, lassie?&rdquo; Sometimes Andy
dropped into his parents&rsquo; vernacular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going to tell a man in his shirt
sleeves why I didn&rsquo;t marry Dr. Flint,&rdquo; said
Nance firmly. &ldquo;It is too unpicturesque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll put on my coat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t! I wouldn&rsquo;t tell a man in a
wet coat, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t like to lay my brown head
on a damp shoulder. Why don&rsquo;t you do as I told
you and dry that shirt sleeve? Hold it close to
the fire, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it unless you tell me why you
didn&rsquo;t marry Dr. Flint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, to keep you from catching your
death of cold, I will tell you, but remember I
have saved your life. It was&mdash;it was because&mdash;because
he didn&rsquo;t have sandy hair and a bad temper,&rdquo;
and Nance was enfolded in the despised
shirt sleeves and found a very nice dry spot on
which to lay her brown head.</p>

<p>The sun had set and twilight was upon them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
The front door opened to admit the master of the
house, but Molly was in ambush ready to catch
him to keep him out of the library. Kizzie had
started in to mend the fire but Molly stopped
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the fire, Kizzie. It is all right
for such a warm evening. Give us tea in the
den.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why all of this mystery?&rdquo; asked Edwin
Green as he followed his wife back to the den,
going on tiptoe as she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andy and Nance are in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Andy McLean! Fine! I want to see him.
Won&rsquo;t he be here to tea? I&rsquo;ll go in and speak to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do no such thing! Edwin Green, you
may be&mdash;in fact, are, a grand lecturer on English,
but you have no practical sense. Don&rsquo;t you know
you might break in just at the wrong moment
and Andy may get off to France without their
making it up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Making up what? Who making up: the Allies
and the central powers?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edwin, you know I mean Nance and
Andy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are they making up? If it is a row,
let&rsquo;s go help them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul shall go in that room until they
come out, unless it is over my dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well! I&rsquo;d rather stay in this room with
your live body than go in there over your dead
one,&rdquo; and the professor pulled his wife down on
the sofa by him, &ldquo;especially if you will give me
some tea,&rdquo; as Kizzie came in grinning with the
tea tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s co&rsquo;tin&rsquo; a-goin&rsquo; on in yander, boss.
The fiah is low an&rsquo; the lights ain&rsquo;t lit, but Miss
Molly she guard that do&rsquo; like a cat do a mouse
hole. Cose Miss Nance ain&rsquo;t got no maw to
futher things up for her but Miss Molly is all
ready to fly off an&rsquo; git the preacher, seems
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember that things were made easy
for me this way when I was addressing my wife,&rdquo;
complained Edwin as he stirred his tea with his
arm around his wife, a combination that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
not have been made had his arm not been long
and Molly still slender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ungrateful man! Why, Judy and Kent
took the bus from Fontainebleau to Barbizon
when they were simply dying to walk, just to
give you a chance. Have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the walk&mdash;I never will&mdash;and
if they really rode on my account, I&rsquo;ll pass
on the favor to other lovers and stay out of my
library until the cows come home; that is, if you
will stay with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly told him then of the whole affair and
how Mildred had righted matters, telling Andy
just exactly the right thing to bring him to his
senses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am almost sure they have made up and are
engaged again,&rdquo; sighed Molly ecstatically. A
romance was dear to her soul and being happily
married herself, she felt like furthering the love
affairs of all her friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are either engaged or dead,&rdquo; laughed
Edwin. &ldquo;Such silence emanating from the library
must bode extreme calamity or extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
bliss. If it continues much longer I think it is
my duty as a householder to break in the door
and offer congratulations or call the coroner, as
the case demands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is getting late. Maybe I had better go in
and ask Andy to stay to dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, who had a deep-rooted objection to
noise and usually talked in a low tone, now spoke
in a loud voice as she bumped her way along the
hall, pushing chairs and rattling the hat rack and
calling out shrilly to the amused husband following
her. Strange to say, she could not remember
on which side of the door the knob was,
although she had lived several years in that house.
She fumblingly hunted it and finally opened the
door with a great rattle.</p>

<p>Nance was seated sedately knitting and Andy
was holding his coat close to the dying flames.
The room was almost dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kizzie should have lighted the lamp and attended
to the fire,&rdquo; Molly said briskly. Oh,
Molly, how could you be so untruthful, blaming
things on poor Kizzie, too? (Molly&rsquo;s conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
did hurt her for dragging Kizzie in and she gave
the girl a long coveted blue hat that she had
meant to keep for second best, feeling that it
might act as a salve on her own tender, truth-loving
soul. Kizzie, quite ignorant of the cause
for this generosity, gratefully accepted the hat
and asked no questions.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it gets dark before one realizes,&rdquo; said
Nance demurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; from the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Andy, your coat is still wet! Mildred
told me you wrapped it around her. I&rsquo;ll get you
Edwin&rsquo;s smoking jacket and have your coat
dried. You must stay to dinner with us. I can
&rsquo;phone your mother not to expect you at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy did not need much persuading, but accepted
the invitation with alacrity. Molly called
up Mrs. McLean to ask for the loan of her son
for dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed that wise lady at the other
end of the wire. &ldquo;I have been expecting a telephone
call for the last half hour. You may keep
him but I shall wait up to see him when he gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
home. I am sur-r-e he&rsquo;ll have something to tell
me. From my back window I saw Nance with
the perambulator full of babies on her way to the
lake and I sent Andy off for a walk, first putting
a flea in his ear by suggesting that the lake was
getting shallower and shallower. He has always
been that inquisitive that I was sur-r-e he would
make for that spot to find out why. I knew that
all those poor-r young folks had to do was to
meet. Keep him, Molly&mdash;and God bless you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little choking sound at the other
end that Molly understood very well. She hung
up the receiver &ldquo;with a smile on her lip but a
tear in her eye.&rdquo; It is all very well for a mother
to be unselfish and want her son to marry and to
be happy, but there is a tug of war going on in
her heart all the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know how I will feel when Dodo gets engaged,&rdquo;
Molly said to Edwin when she told him
of what Mrs. McLean had said; but that young
father went off into such shouts of laughter,
Molly had a feeling that mere man could never
understand a mother&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>PLANS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I have no idea of going through dinner without
letting you and old Ed know all about us!&rdquo;
said Andy as he took his place at Molly&rsquo;s hospitable
board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you?&rdquo; asked Molly, who was
growing deceitful, her husband feared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Nance and me! I can&rsquo;t keep it any
longer,&rdquo; declared the happy young doctor.
Nance kept her eyes on her plate but her mouth
was twitching with amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you and Nance?&rdquo; solemnly
asked the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re engaged!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Not really?&rdquo; and Edwin grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Andy! I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; and Molly reached
a hand out to her two friends, who were perforce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
placed across the table from each other since
there were only four for dinner.</p>

<p>Nance got up and kissed her hostess. &ldquo;Oh,
Molly, you are too lovely! Don&rsquo;t you know that
I know that Andy and I have not fooled you one
moment? Don&rsquo;t I see brandy peaches on the side
table all ready for dessert, and don&rsquo;t you know
that I know that those precious articles are only
brought out on highdays and holidays? Isn&rsquo;t
that fruit cake I smell, that you know perfectly
well you made and put away for next Christmas
so it would be ripe and get better and better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I had to express my feelings somehow,
and how did I know that you and Andy were going
to tell your secret this very evening? I knew
I mustn&rsquo;t say a thing until you two said something,
and if I could not say anything, I could at
least feed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I can say, Andy, is that if your experience
in choosing a girl from that class of 19&mdash; is
as fortunate as mine, you will be a pretty happy
man, and by Jove, I believe you are running me
a mighty close second,&rdquo; and to the astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of his wife, as Edwin Green was certainly a far
from demonstrative man, he actually jumped
from his seat and embraced Nance. Then Andy
felt that he must kiss Molly, and Kizzie coming
in at this juncture almost dropped the dish she
was carrying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sich a-carryin&rsquo;s on I never seed. I&rsquo;m
a-thinking you folks had better sort yo&rsquo;selves,&rdquo;
and the girl went off chortling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me your plans!&rdquo; demanded Molly
when they settled down to dinner. Strange to
say, they had got rather mixed up in the promiscuous
embracing that had been going on, and
Edwin and Andy had changed places. Edwin
found himself seated at Molly&rsquo;s side while Andy
had greatly disarranged the table by plumping
himself down by his Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are to be married immediately,&rdquo; announced
Andy stoutly.</p>

<p>Nance gasped. The fact was they had been
so busy explaining the past and living in the
present while the fire had died so low in the library,
that the future had not been touched upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I may start for France at any time
now, but before I go I mean to get me a war
bride. It will be pretty bad leaving her, but then
the war can&rsquo;t last forever, and I have decided it
is my duty to go help, and I fancy it still is.
When Uncle Sam steps in, maybe he can finish
up things in a hurry. Then I can get back to
Nance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back to me, indeed! If you think you
are going without me, Andy McLean, you are
vastly mistaken. If it is your duty to go help,
it is my duty, too. Oh, I know I am no trained
nurse, but I can do lots of other things. Dr.
Flint says I am better than most trained
nurses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance stopped short. She should not have
mentioned Dr. Flint. Only suppose it had hurt
Andy&rsquo;s feelings! Not a bit of it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully for Flint!&rdquo; cried the accepted lover.
&ldquo;Oh, Nance, would you go with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can scrub and cook and take care of babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; teased Andy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will always be near and pull them
out of the water when I let them fall in,&rdquo; suggested
Nance. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will! Just as near as I can get!&rdquo;
and Andy hitched his chair a little closer, thereby
disarranging the table even more than he had
done before. But although Molly was a very
careful housekeeper and most particular about
the looks of her table, she cared not one whit, but
beamed on Andy as though he were the pink of
propriety instead of a naughty boy.</p>

<p>What a change a little lovering had made in
the appearance of both Nance and Andy! The
girl&rsquo;s clear skin was flushed and her eyes sparkling.
The corners of her mouth had no trace of
downward tendency now. The years of sadness
and confinement spent in nursing her father and
mother were forgotten. Nance had come into
her own&mdash;her woman&rsquo;s heritage: to be beloved, to
be guarded and cherished; at the same time to
know that she was to be the companion, the helpmeet.
As for Andy,&mdash;he beamed with joy. His
face had lost the stern lines that had so distressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
his mother. He looked again like the boy he was,
not like the tired, disappointed man she had
known of late.</p>

<p>Nance had no romantic notions of what life in
France meant in that early spring of 1917. She
knew that there was no room for drones and unproductive
consumers in that war-worn country.
She knew that in marrying Andy and going with
his unit she was to face work, privations, danger,
even death; but with her eyes open she was determined
to see it through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would enlist in the United States army,&rdquo;
Andy said to his host after dinner, as they
lounged in the den and puffed away at their comforting
pipes, &ldquo;but I feel that I can be of more
good right now in France where they are crying
out for surgeons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be many days now before war is declared,&rdquo;
sighed Edwin. &ldquo;By jiminy! I hate
myself for not being able to get in the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad, old man! A fellow with a wife and
two children has to think of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I wouldn&rsquo;t let Molly know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
I feel about it for any thing. I am not so young
as I was, but I am stronger now than I was as a
youth. As for my eyes&mdash;they are good enough
eyes in glasses and my bald head would be no
drawback.&rdquo; Edwin always would call his
sparsely covered top &ldquo;bald,&rdquo; but Molly, by diligent
care, had made two blades of grass grow
where only one had grown before, and with a
microscope one could see the beginnings of a
fuzzy crop of hair, at least so the fond wife insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet she would say go, if it were put to her,&rdquo;
said Andy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do it, though! It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if it is put up to her, I bet on Molly
Brown!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ALL THE OLD GIRLS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a wonderful scheme, Edwin,&rdquo; said
Molly when she had finally engineered her husband
out of the den and Nance in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound you have. I never saw such a
Mrs. Machiavelli!&mdash;First I mustn&rsquo;t go in the library
but stick to the den, and now that I had
just made myself at home in the den I must flee
to the library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly laughed at her husband&rsquo;s pretended discomfiture
as he settled himself to find out what
was going on at the front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now read the news to me while I knit.
There is no knowing how soon our own boys will
be needing sweaters. I feel that every stitch I
put in is important. Mercy, what a mess my
knitting is in! I do believe that little monkey of
a Mildred has been working on it. But she can&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
purl at all! Someone else has done it. No one
has been here but Andy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t think Andy McLean would attempt
a sweater,&rdquo; laughed Edwin. &ldquo;Maybe
Nance is responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Nance is a past master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might have been trying a one-handed
stunt and failed. I don&rsquo;t believe even Prussian
efficiency could knit and get proposed to and accept
all at the same time. Under the circumstances
I think she should be forgiven for purling
where she should have knitted and knitting where
she should have purled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sound like the prayer book,&rdquo; said Molly,
patiently pulling out stitches and deftly picking
up where Andy asked to hold Nance&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I
almost feel as though I were committing a sacrilege.
This sweater is like a piece of tapestry
where the lady has recorded her emotions, using
the medium she knew best. I just know dear old
Nance tried to go on with her work all the time
Andy was making love,&rdquo; and Molly wiped a wee
tear off on the ball of yarn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you that sweater could tell tales if it
could speak,&rdquo; teased Edwin. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
sew in one of your golden hairs so that the happy
soldier who finally gets it will have some inkling
of how the beautiful girl looks who made it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly! But don&rsquo;t you want to hear what my
scheme is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dying to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to try to get the old Queen&rsquo;s
girls, that is our &rsquo;special crowd, to come to
Nance&rsquo;s wedding. Katherine and Edith Williams
are both in New York; Judy is there; Otoyo
Sen is in Boston; Margaret Wakefield is in
Washington; Jessie Lynch is in Philadelphia&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there no husbands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, plenty of them, but I&rsquo;m not going
to invite husbands! The babies can come if the
mothers can&rsquo;t leave them, but the husbands are
not invited. Katherine Williams and Jessie
Lynch are the only ones who are still in single
blessedness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to have them all stay here?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
asked Edwin in amazement, never having quite
accustomed himself to Molly&rsquo;s wholesale hospitality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I can manage it finely. That
will be only six extra ones. Why, at Chatsworth
we had that much company any time. This
house is really almost as big as Chatsworth and
there we had our huge family to put away besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I can say is that you are a wonder, but
please don&rsquo;t break yourself down over this wedding.
What does Nance say to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked her, but I know she is dying
to see all the girls together. We have often
talked about it, and wedding or no wedding I was
going to try to get them here this next month.
Otoyo has already promised to come, you remember,
and now she can just hurry up and get here
for the wedding. She will have to bring Cho-Cho-San,
who is just a bit older than Mildred.
They can have great times together. You don&rsquo;t
mind, do you, honey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind! Of course not! You know I like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
company. I was just afraid you were giving
yourself too large an order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance, on being consulted, thought it would
be wonderful to see all the old girls again before
embarking on her great adventure, so letters
were forthwith written and sent to the six friends,
who one and all joyfully accepted. Business,
husbands, babies, society were to be left behind
for this grand reunion of the old Queen&rsquo;s crowd.</p>

<p>Otoyo Sen, now Mrs. Matsuki, whose exceedingly
regretfully but honorable husband was
gone on short journey and baby Cho-Cho-San
must stay with humble mother for the wedding.
As Molly had expected to have the child, this was
as it should be.</p>

<p>Katherine had demanded leave from the lectures
she was delivering, and Edith had an excellent
nurse for her baby and could leave her
family easily. Margaret Wakefield had no children
and was able to cancel the many engagements
that such an important person was sure to
have, and her house was in such good running
order that her husband, the rising young congressman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
would want for nothing in her absence.
Jessie Lynch had declined two luncheons, a dinner
dance, and a theatre party, besides breaking
as many more engagements in order to come to
this wedding of the old college friend. Jessie
was still unmarried although she had been the one
that the prophecy had married off first. Pretty
little Jessie had so many lovers it was hard to
choose among them.</p>

<p>The very first reply was from Judy and she,
Judy-like, answered in person. <a href="#Frontispiece">She blew in at
nightfall with a huge suitcase</a>, many parcels and
her gay chintz knitting bag stuffed full of various
things besides knitting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kent was dying to come but I told him no
children and dogs were allowed,&rdquo; announced that
glowing young matron as she dropped her belongings,
scattering them all over the library
floor, and rushed around kissing and hugging
everybody in the room. &ldquo;I have come to help.
I know you, Molly! You always act like triplets
when there is any work on hand, and I know you,
too, Nance! Your New England conscience will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
make you neglect Andy rather than seem to shirk
work. I am here to sweep and dust and cook,
take care of babies, or even to flirt with Andy if
Nance does not look after him. I am going to
dress the bride; find Edwin&rsquo;s collar buttons and
studs for his dress shirt; see that the best man has
the ring safe in his pocket; pay the preacher; put
in the supply of rice and old shoes&mdash;in fact,&rdquo; she
sang:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the mate of the Nancy brig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bo&rsquo;sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Greens had been sitting quite sedately
around the lamp engaged in their various occupations
when Judy burst in on them. The professor
was getting up a lecture for the morrow,
Mildred was cutting out paper dolls, and Molly
and Nance had for the moment put down their
eternal knitting and were giving their attention
to whipping on lace for the modest trousseau.
But the whirlwind that came in swept aside all
sane business. Needles were hastily thrust in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
cloth; thimbles were mislaid; paper dolls
dropped for something livelier; and lecture preparation
abandoned. When Judy, after the
breathless announcement of having come and her
reasons for coming, began on the Nancy Bell,
Edwin sprang to his feet and, joining in the
dance that Judy was improvising, sang in a rollicking
mixture of tenor and baritone:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;And he shook his fist and tore his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till I really felt afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking the man had been drinking,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so I simply said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, elderly man, it&rsquo;s little I know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the duties of men of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I&rsquo;ll eat my hand if I understand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">However you can be<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;At once a cook and a captain bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the mate of the Nancy brig,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bo&rsquo;sun tight, and a midshipmite,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the crew of the captain&rsquo;s gig.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Little Mildred clapped her hands to see her
dignified father cutting pigeon wings. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
yet to learn that dignity and Mrs. Kent Brown
could not stay in the same room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy! It is good to see you,&rdquo; gasped
Molly when the chorus, in which all of them
joined, had been sung over twice. &ldquo;What a
Judy you are, anyhow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take your suitcase up-stairs,&rdquo; suggested
Edwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will carry your parcels,&rdquo; insisted
Nance, who was happy indeed over seeing her old
college friend again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not a bit of use in taking a thing
up-stairs. All of my clothes are in the knitting
bag. Those parcels are wedding presents and
the suitcase is full of all kinds of plunder. This
big bundle is a tea basket from Kent and me.
You and Andy can go to housekeeping in it. We
thought you would rather have it than silver or
cut glass, since you are going where there are no
side boards to speak of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Judy, how splendid! It is exactly what
I have been longing for,&rdquo; cried Nance, opening
the charming Japanese basket. &ldquo;Only look,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
plates, cups and saucers, tea pot, coffee pot, sugar
bowl, cream pitcher, spoons, knives, forks, cannisters
for coffee, tea, sugar, crackers, hard alcohol
stove, chafing dish and tea kettle! All packed
in two square feet of basket!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular kitchen cabinet!&rdquo; declared Molly.
&ldquo;Nobody but Nance could ever get them packed
again in the right place, I am sure, Nance and
Otoyo, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just know Otoyo is going to bring her one
like mine! I never thought of that when I got
it. I saw it at Vantine&rsquo;s and simply fell in love
with it. I wanted it so bad myself I got it for
Nance. If Otoyo does bring one, I will exchange
mine,&rdquo; said Judy generously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed no! I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having two
one bit and I am certainly not going to give
up my very first wedding present,&rdquo; blushed
Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a steamer rug from dear old Mary
Stuart. See how warm and soft it is! This is
a pocket set of Shakespeare from Jimmy Lufton!
He brought it to the train!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But how lovely! I didn&rsquo;t dream of getting
any presents,&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did they know about Nance?&rdquo; asked
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;phoned them! I got your letter while
Kent was at the armory so I just called up everybody
I knew and told them the news. There is
no telling what the excess calls will amount to,
but I had either to do that or burst! &rsquo;Phoning
is cheaper than bursting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I bet you can&rsquo;t guess what is in
this great round box,&rdquo; said the effervescent
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wedding hat!&rdquo; solemnly suggested
Edwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hat your grandmother! Guess again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A German bomb!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Cold, cold! You&rsquo;ll never get it! It
is a wedding cake sent by Madeline Petit and
Judith Blount. Now what do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; cried Molly, as she lifted the
cake from its careful packing. &ldquo;Fruit cake with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
white icing! How on earth did they happen to
do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I &rsquo;phoned them, too, because I always
did like little Madeline in spite of the fact
that she talks a fellow&rsquo;s ear off. I am not so fond
of Judith, but I do admire her. She has spunked
up so splendidly and taken her medicine like a
man. She and Madeline are doing a thriving
business in a swell part of town with tea rooms
and all kinds of fancy cakes. Judith was the one
who suggested sending the cake, Madeline told
me. She said Judith said she knew Molly
Brown would work herself to death over the
wedding and she, for one, was going to send
something to help out Molly. She said you
were just goose enough to make the cake at
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had planned to do it,&rdquo; laughed Molly. &ldquo;I
was going to start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This huge box is candy to eat right now&mdash;that
is Kent! I am almost afraid to eat it. He
wanted to come so bad that he might have
poisoned it for spite.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let him come? Dear old
Kent!&rdquo; exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I knew perfectly well that it is some
job to sleep seven persons outside of one&rsquo;s own
household, and it is doubly difficult when there
are two sexes. Kent is as busy as can be anyhow:
drilling day and night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kent Brown had taken the training at Plattsburg
and was then engaged in passing on this
training to a company of militia in New York.
He and Judy were eagerly awaiting the declaration
of war by the United States. There was no
such thing as neutrality for them. Having been
in France in that August of 1914, Judy considered
herself already at war and Kent enthusiastically
shared the sentiments of his wife. He
was prepared to leave his profession of architecture,
in which he was proving himself very successful,
and join any regiment that was likely to
see service.</p>

<p>Judy had done exactly what the Marquis
d&rsquo;Ochtè had asked her to do: she had come back
to New York and plunged into war relief work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Because of her enthusiasm and untiring energy
she had been of great assistance in recruiting
workers. Her admiring husband said that she
was what one might call a real booster. Any
campaign Judy plunged in was sure to be a
whirlwind campaign. She had her father&rsquo;s capacity
for infinite work. Up to a certain period
it had evinced itself in the form of infinite play,
but now that the serious side of life had presented
itself to her, the girl was working quite
as hard as she had ever played. There was never
anything half-way about our Judy. In New
York she was canvassing for suffrage, keeping
up her painting, and with her own hands cutting
and folding enough surgical dressings to fill the
peace ship, besides rounding up many workers
for the cause. With it all she managed to be a
very satisfactory wife and housekeeper. She and
Kent were blissfully happy. There were red letter
days in their calendar when both of them
stopped working and went on some mad frolic.
They had made many friends in New York,
friends with whom they both worked and played.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
They had a hospitable apartment where the redoubtable
Ca&rsquo;line reigned in the tiny kitchen,
Ca&rsquo;line, trained by Mrs. Brown at Chatsworth
and chastened by dear old Aunt Mary until she
&ldquo;knowed her place an&rsquo; kep&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it fun to see Judy again? I hope my
readers feel as glad for her to come bounding into
these pages as the Greens and Nance Oldham did
when she opened the door of the library at the
Square Deal and, upsetting everything, scattered
papers and parcels hither and yon, her vivid
personality permeating every corner of the
room.</p>

<p>Just before Judy said good-night, she paused
and exclaimed, &ldquo;I must tell you, Molly, how
much I enjoy the dear little Virginia girls you
have passed on to me. The Tucker twins and
Page Allison are just about the nicest girls I
know, and Mary Flannagan is a duck. I used to
be an awful snob about college girls,&mdash;somehow,
I thought girls who did not go to college were not
worth knowing, but I have changed my mind
since I have met these girls. They are an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
lot and as far as I can see know as much as
we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would like them. I simply fell
in love with them last spring in Charleston.
Have you met their father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he must be some father! The girls
call him Zebedee, which appeals to me, having
always called mine Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zebedee? What a strange name!&rdquo; said
Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say it is because nobody ever believes
he is their father and so they want to know:
&lsquo;Who is the father of Zebedee&rsquo;s children?&rsquo; It
seems he is only about twenty years older than
they are and is one of those persons who never
gets on in years. They declare they are really
more mature than he is and not nearly so agile,&rdquo;
laughed Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been meaning to ask them to Wellington
and must certainly do it before they go back
to Richmond,&rdquo; declared Molly, on hospitality
bent as usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, honey, but let&rsquo;s get Nance safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
married and the wedding feast disposed of,&rdquo; insisted
Judy, who thought her brother-in-law
looked a little alarmed, fearing that Molly might
decide that this was as good a time as any to have
the Tuckers and Page Allison visit them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I didn&rsquo;t mean now but later on,
although it is a pity to put it off too long,&rdquo; teased
Molly, seeing the worried look on Edwin&rsquo;s face.
&ldquo;I might make up two bunks on the pantry
shelves and let one of them sleep in the bath tub.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>AN INTERESTING COUPLE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I came from New York with a very interesting
couple,&rdquo; said Judy the next day as she vigorously
stitched away at some of the wedding finery.
&ldquo;Of course I talked to them&mdash;I always
talk to the interesting persons I meet traveling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Molly as she finished a garment
and put it aside for Kizzie to press.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never do,&rdquo; sighed Nance. &ldquo;I do wish I
had some of your and Judy&rsquo;s warm-heartedness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Your heart is just as warm as
any that beats,&rdquo; objected Molly. &ldquo;Ask Andy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, honey, Vermont is Vermont and
Kentucky is Kentucky! Persons from Kentucky
haven&rsquo;t quite as hard shells as the ones
from Vermont, but when once you get below the
shell the kernel is about the same. You and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Molly couldn&rsquo;t be any more alike than Kentucky
beeches and Vermont pines,&rdquo; said Judy, pausing
long enough in her labors to give Nance an encouraging
pat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and pines stay green all the year
around,&rdquo; said Molly. &ldquo;It is much better to be
a pine than a beech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell us about the interesting couple,&rdquo;
laughed Nance, much comforted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were from Alsace but were very
French in their sympathies. They looked a little
German but they spoke beautiful French except
that they did have a tendency to call Paris
&lsquo;Baree.&rsquo; They love Paris as much as I do. The
man, Misel is his name, Monsieur Jean Misel,&mdash;is
the best informed person I have seen for many
a day. He knows the war situation as few persons
do, I am sure. He seems to have been everywhere
and known everybody. He even knew my
father,&mdash;at least, knew all about him and was
greatly interested in the fact that Bobby is soon
to sail for France to help rebuild the roads.
Madame Misel is much quieter than her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
but is very intelligent, I am sure. With all her
reserve, she never misses a trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was this interesting couple going?&rdquo;
asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming right here to Wellington! They
have taken a cottage in the village and mean to
live here. He is writing and she wants to do war
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How splendid!&rdquo; cried Molly. &ldquo;We need
workers more than I can tell you. The students
give what time they can, but a full college course
is about all a normal girl can take care of in the
way of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must call on them right off, Molly. I
will go with you and Edwin must go, too. I
know he will like Monsieur Misel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him, but Edwin is sure to want to
know why this lover of Paris is not fighting for
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the poor fellow! He is quite lame&mdash;walks
with a cane and a crutch. He hinted
rather darkly that his lameness is in some way
due to the Germans, but I do not know in just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
what way. He was sensitive about his affliction,
so his wife told me when he left us and went in
the smoker, so naturally I did not ask him how
the Germans were responsible for it. He is a
young man, too, that is under forty, and very
handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Green was quite interested in what
Judy had to tell him of the Misels. He promised
to call with Molly and do all he could to make
Wellington pleasant for them. He looked forward
with pleasure to the conversations Judy assured
him he would enjoy with that highly educated
gentleman. Holding the chair of English
in a woman&rsquo;s college is not bad, but there were
times when Edwin Green longed for more man
talk. He and Dr. McLean were sworn friends
and saw much of each other, but they both of
them welcomed with enthusiasm any masculine
newcomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if your friend could teach French,
Judy,&rdquo; asked her brother-in-law. &ldquo;Miss Walker
is quite put to it for the end of the term. The
French professor took French leave last week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
He seemed too old to hold anything more
weighty than a pen, but he has gone to fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the terrible part of it,&rdquo; sighed Judy.
&ldquo;They say all the superannuated dancing masters
and French teachers are leaving to take up
arms. It means that France is having a hard
time. Why, oh why, don&rsquo;t we hurry up and get
in the game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The call was made and Molly and her husband
were quite as enthusiastic as Judy had been over
the charms of the new neighbors. Monsieur
Misel seemed the very person to take up the labors
of the flown French professor, and Miss
Walker accordingly engaged him. Molly felt
she must have them to dinner in spite of the fact
that she was deep in the preparations for the
wedding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a very simple dinner and not make
company of them, just make them feel at home,&rdquo;
she declared, and her husband and Nance and
Judy smiled knowingly. Molly always would
have company and there was no use in trying to
stop her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know when I die she will feel called upon
to give me a good wake,&rdquo; laughed Edwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if people come hungry to your
funeral, I&rsquo;ll feed them,&rdquo; answered Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are our new friends, the Misels, hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not hungry for food, but they must be
lonely so far away from their country and
friends. Anyhow, they are invited now and have
accepted, so there is no use in teasing me. You
just see that there are cigars here for Monsieur
Misel to smoke after dinner, and I&rsquo;ll attend to the
rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How sad it was to see a man of Misel&rsquo;s beauty
a hopeless cripple! He was a tall, stalwart fellow
with a military bearing which the use of a
crutch and cane could not take from him. His
lameness had not affected the comeliness of his
limbs or his erect carriage. He had very courteous
manners and it seemed to be very hard on
him not to spring from his seat when a lady entered
the room.</p>

<p>On the evening of Molly&rsquo;s informal dinner
when Nance, who was the only member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
household who had not met the strangers, came
into the library, Misel stood up to be introduced,
but his wife gave a low cry of alarm and sprang
to his assistance, eagerly placing his crutch in one
hand, his cane in the other. He sank to his seat
with a smothered groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean, Jean! What am I to do with you?&rdquo;
said Madame Misel irritably. &ldquo;He is so imprudent,&rdquo;
apologetically to Molly, who had tears in
her eyes at this exhibition of courage and weakness.
She could well understand how Monsieur
Misel&rsquo;s courteous desires could get the better of
his strength.</p>

<p>Andy McLean was present and the doctor
in him immediately became interested in the
pitiable case. He had none of the hesitation
Judy had shown in regard to questioning
the Misels concerning the cause of the lameness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your trouble?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
&ldquo;If you can stand without support as you did a
moment ago, I see no reason why you cannot be
cured.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In time! In time!&rdquo; said Misel with patient
resignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has had the best medical attention,&rdquo; put
in his wife.</p>

<p>Madame Misel usually spoke with a kind of
slow hesitation, but now her words came rapidly.
She had the air of trying to shield her husband
from farther questioning on the part of Andy.
Andy, however, was totally oblivious of this fact
and went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is his surgeon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great F&mdash;&mdash;, in Baree!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked Andy, impressed
by the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;said&mdash;nerve centres&mdash;disturbed,&rdquo;
answered Madame, returning to her hesitating
speech. She did not stammer at all but seemed
to pause to choose her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can be of any assistance to you, I hope
you will call on me,&rdquo; said Andy kindly.</p>

<p>In the meantime Misel sat with his hands over
his eyes as though in great pain and his wife
hovered over him solicitously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner was soon announced and this time the
lame man arose very cautiously and made his way
slowly to the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindly&mdash;go&mdash;in&mdash;front&mdash;of&mdash;us,&rdquo; faltered
Madame, and Molly marshalled her family and
guests so that the Misels might bring up the rear.
She fully appreciated how the wife felt about
wanting to be the one to assist her poor lame
husband. If her Edwin had been so crippled
no one should have helped him but his own
wife.</p>

<p>Molly turned to smile on the poor woman for
whom her heart was sore. She could well understand
the misery it must bring to see one most
dear having to suffer so acutely. There was a
dark place in the hall leading to the dining-room
and the hostess feared the poor lame man might
stumble there, so she stopped to warn him of a
rug. She distinctly heard Madame say to her
husband in no gentle tones but with an asperity
almost malevolent:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Narr! Narr!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>Molly began assiduously to hunt in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
archives of her brain for the small German vocabulary
which she could call her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Narr!</i> What can <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">narr</i> mean?&rdquo; the question
kept recurring to her as dinner progressed. She
visualized lists of words in a worn old blank book
used at school. &ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Narr</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nase</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nesse</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nest!&rdquo;</i>
She tried to remember the English on the opposite
page. How well she remembered the little
old book wherein was written the despised
German exercises. The script in itself had been
almost impossible to learn and as for mastering
the language,&mdash;she had been so half-hearted
about it that she had not been compelled to keep
it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Narr</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nase</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nesse</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nest!&rdquo;</i> ran through and
through and over and over in her mind. Suddenly
just as Professor Green asked her what she
would say to adjourning to the library, the list
of English words flashed on her brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fool, nose, nephew, nest&rsquo;!&rdquo; she cried audibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Edwin feared his Molly had gone
crazy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;mean, yes&mdash;coffee in the library!&rdquo;
and she arose from her seat in confusion.</p>

<p>Why should that calm-looking, slow-speaking
woman call her poor lame husband a fool?
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Narr! Narr!</i> It was certainly strange.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>AN OLD-TIME PARTY</small></h2>


<p>The first one of the old girls to arrive was
Otoyo, Mrs. Matsuki, with the little Cho-Cho-San.
Otoyo had changed not at all in the years
that had elapsed since college days. Perhaps an
added matronly dignity was hers, but this was
not much in evidence when she was with her dear
old friends. She was beautifully and elegantly
dressed. All her clothes were made of the most
exquisite fabrics. Her blouses were of the finest
and sheerest, if of linen; and the heaviest and
richest, if of silk. Her furs were the furriest and
her suits of the most approved cut and material.
Her little boots were a marvel of fit and style.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect, like a Japanese puzzle!&rdquo; Judy declared.
&ldquo;Every little part made to fit every
other little part!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the whole a wonderful creation like
some rare print or bit of pottery!&rdquo; agreed Molly.</p>

<p>Otoyo had adapted herself to the manners and
customs of her adopted country, wearing them
with the same grace she did the garments. She
had an English nurse for the little Cho-Cho-San
and the child was being reared as much like
American children as possible. A tiny little
thing, she was, with coal black hair and slanting
eyes. There was much mischief peeping from
those eyes around the tip-tilted nose. The mouth
was a crimson bow, ever ready to break into a
tinkling laugh. She and Mildred rushed together
as though their short lives had been spent
waiting for this opportunity. Mildred was
younger by several months but taller by several
inches than the little Japanese. What a picture
the two children made! Mildred, with her red
gold hair curling in little ringlets all over her
head, her round rosy face and wide hazel eyes,
was exactly the opposite to Cho-Cho-San, with
her straight, bobbed, ebony black hair, her oval,
olive face and almond eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve I can tote you,&rdquo; said Mildred, who
often used words current in Kizzie&rsquo;s vernacular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tote! Tote! What is tote?&rdquo; and the tinkling
laugh rang out like glass chimes assailed by
a sudden gust of wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I tote my dolly&mdash;an&rsquo; Mr. Murphy totes
the coal&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; Daddy totes his books to
lexures&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I tote something, also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can tote Dodo. He&rsquo;s my baby
brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee! I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee!&rdquo; and the
little thing danced in glee. &ldquo;My honorable
mother told me when I came for a visit to her
friends that it would be all &rsquo;appiness.&rdquo; The
English nurse had left her stamp upon her charge
just as Kizzie had upon Mildred. The occasional
dropping of an h was the result. Cho-Cho-San&rsquo;s
lingo was most amusing with its mixture of Cockney
and Japanese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d look &rsquo;zactly like my Jap dolly if you
only had a bald spot on top,&rdquo; said Mildred as she
led her new friend to the sunny nursery where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and Dodo reigned supreme with the Irish Katy
to do their bidding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And phwat Haythen is this?&rdquo; cried Katy
when she saw the little Japanese girl. &ldquo;And
ain&rsquo;t she the cutey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my bes&rsquo; beloved,&rdquo; announced Mildred.
&ldquo;Me&rsquo;n&rsquo; Cho-Cho-San is gonter be each other&rsquo;s
doll babies. I&rsquo;m a-gonter be her kick-up dolly
an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s gonter be my Jap dolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee! I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee!&rdquo; was all
the tiny Haythen could say as she danced around
the nursery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Nance done said we could be her flower
girls, too,&rdquo; went on the loquacious Mildred.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;s all gonter get married day after another
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the doll babies going to be married!&rdquo;
sang the guest. &ldquo;Kick-up dolls and Japanese
dolls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Williams girls arrived next and close on
their heels Margaret and Jessie. I cannot bring
myself to designate the girls by their married
names any more than they could one another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Husbands were not much in evidence at that
gathering. The talk was all of the past. Of course
Andy, the soon-to-be husband, was allowed
some consideration, although the first night after
the arrival of the guests even he was debarred
and the old chums had a kimono party in the library.
The host fortunately had an engagement
that took him from home, otherwise he would
have had to spend his evening shut up in his den.</p>

<p>The revellers opened the ball by singing
&ldquo;Drink her down,&rdquo; to each one in the crowd.
Molly&rsquo;s old guitar was brought out and Otoyo
produced a tiny ukelele which added much to
the harmony. After the singing was finished and
every one drunk down, the words that were used
most often were: &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo; All of
the scrapes were recalled and talked over. Bits
of gossip were recounted that had never come to
light before, the noblesse oblige of the college
spirit having kept matters dark, but now that the
years had rolled by there seemed to be no longer
reason for silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get into some mischief this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
night!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been good and pious
so long I feel like whooping life up a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m game,&rdquo; drawled Katherine Williams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I hear an aye from the eminent educator?&rdquo;
questioned Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do whatever it is if I don&rsquo;t have to walk
too far,&rdquo; said lazy Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are you to do?&rdquo; from Margaret,
in whom the spirit of adventure was not so rampant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to the Gentleman from Missouri!&rdquo;
cried Judy. &ldquo;Come on and we&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like very muchly to be in the vehicle of
musicians but I also like muchly to know what is
the ultimately destination,&rdquo; said Otoyo softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She means the band wagon! She means the
band wagon!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Oh, my dear little
Otoyo, if you were changed I could not bear this
sad grey world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Others, too, have notly changed,&rdquo; said Otoyo
slyly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you planning, Judy honey?&rdquo;
asked Molly, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any plan&mdash;nothing but something
crazy and adventurous. I am dead tired of being
so good and proper. I have rolled bandages and
drawn threads and cut gauze until I feel like a
machine. I want to have a romantic adventure.
I&rsquo;d like to put a tick-tack on Miss Walker&rsquo;s window&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like to burn asafetida on the teacher&rsquo;s
stove, or put red pepper in the Bible so when
she opens it to read she would sneeze her head
off. I might content myself with making an
apple pie bed for my dear brother-in-law&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please not that!&rdquo; begged Molly. &ldquo;My
supply of sheets is stretched to the limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O. Henry would advise you to go out in the
night and await Adventure. Adventure is always
just around the corner. Step up to him
and tap him on the shoulder,&rdquo; suggested Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very comfortable in here,&rdquo; purred Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Infirm of purpose!&rdquo; cried Judy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not infirm of purpose,&rdquo; said
Molly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been purposing all along to have
a Welsh rarebit and make some cloudbursts and
I&rsquo;m still going to do it. If you Don Quixotes
want to go off and hunt trouble in the meantime,
though, you are welcome, only don&rsquo;t stay too
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t Molly the broad-minded guy, though?
Live and let live was always Molly. Aren&rsquo;t you
coming, Nance?&rdquo; And Judy sprang from her
cross-legged position on the rug ready for any
fray. &ldquo;Come on, Margaret! Come on, Edith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know Edith is too stuffy to do
such a thing? She&rsquo;s afraid her perfectly good
husband would not approve,&rdquo; teased her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such thing, but I&rsquo;m not going. I mean
to help Molly. You crazy kids go get in all the
trouble you want to. Me for the house this
night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Margaret? You, too, must keep the
&lsquo;home fires burning,&rsquo; I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to stir the rarebit,&rdquo; announced
Margaret firmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pick out nuts for the cloudbursts,&rdquo;
purred Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must whip lace,&rdquo; blushed Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you middle-aged persons! I bite my
thumb at you!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Who among you
is young enough to go hunt adventure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I intended to go,&rdquo; said Katherine,
looking rather longingly at the crowded shelves
of poetry that she was simply dying to poke in.
&ldquo;No one is going to call me middle-aged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, too, will take greatly pleasure to
knock the kindling from the shoulder of Adventure,&rdquo;
said little Otoyo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She means the chip! She means the chip!&rdquo;
screamed the delighted Judy. &ldquo;Oh, Otoyo, I
love you in all the world next to my immediate
family!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took but a moment to slip on great coats
over kimonos and then, heavily veiled, the three
adventuresses started forth, with admonitions
from Molly not to be gone more than half an
hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And please don&rsquo;t get arrested!&rdquo; she called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
after them. &ldquo;Kent says he always expects Judy
to get arrested some day. This spirit of adventure
seizes her every now and then and nothing
will stop her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well it struck her here at Wellington
instead of in New York. She can&rsquo;t get into very
much mischief here,&rdquo; laughed Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could in the old days,&rdquo; put in Margaret,
&ldquo;but now that she is not compelled to keep rules
I fancy she will not care to break them. What a
Judy she is! It must be great to have her in the
family, Molly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is! She is the favorite in-law with
the whole lot of Browns. Mother adores her and
all the boys think she is just about perfect. Even
Aunt Clay can&rsquo;t help liking her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they will find to-night. I almost
wish I had left the lace off of this old camisole
and gone with them,&rdquo; said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you need not hunt adventure right
now,&rdquo; drawled Jessie. &ldquo;Any girl who is deliberately
getting married and going to the war
zone will have enough to keep her busy for a lifetime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t believe they will do more than go
to the drug store and get limeades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know Judy and Katherine,&rdquo; said
Edith, &ldquo;and little Otoyo with her determination
to knock the kindling from the shoulder of Adventure.
I wonder what Mr. Matsuki would say
if he could know that his sedate little wife is engaged
in such a harum scarum pursuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he would just smile and bow and look
more like an ivory Buddha than ever. Otoyo has
the charming little gentleman completely under
her thumb. She works a kind of mental jiu jitsu
on him and he just lets her have her way. The
joke of it is he thinks she is the most docile, obedient
little wife in all the world, and so she is.
She simply makes him want what she wants,&rdquo; explained
Molly.</p>

<p>Molly was busily engaged in the preparations
for the midnight feast. It would have been
simpler and easier just to have gone to the
kitchen and made the rarebit over the gas stove,
but that would not have been at all like college
days and this night must be as near a reproduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of those times as possible. Chafing dishes
must be used and dishes must be scarce or the
spell would be broken.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>ADVENTURE</small></h2>


<p>It was after ten o&rsquo;clock as the three veiled figures
glided from the square house on the campus.
The night was dark, fit for the deed they had to
do. They did not know what the deed was but
whatever it was the intrepid females were fully
prepared to do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First we&rsquo;ll go by Prexy&rsquo;s house and perchance
she may see us and then we&rsquo;ll run. That
will be fun!&rdquo; suggested Judy. &ldquo;Nothing would
so warm my old blood as to be taken for a junior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It so happened that a consultation was being
held at the president&rsquo;s home and as they passed,
Miss Walker opened the front door and Professor
Green emerged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ministers and saints defend us! My
brother-in-law!&rdquo; cried Judy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; called Miss Walker as the
three girls ran swiftly out of the broad band of
light pouring from the open door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run for your lives!&rdquo; hissed Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I chase them?&rdquo; laughed Professor
Green. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sighed poor Prexy. &ldquo;I fancy they are
up to no harm, but it is late for girls to be out
alone. Such terrible things seem to be happening
all over the world. I&rsquo;ll have to deliver a lecture
to the whole student body, I am afraid,
about late rambles and pranks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those girls were veiled, so evidently whatever
they were doing they did not want to be
recognized. I&rsquo;d hate to hold your job, Miss
Walker. I&rsquo;d much rather be the humble professor
of English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely it is not a sinecure,&rdquo; laughed the president,
&ldquo;but when all is told, my girls are a pretty
good lot. Their mischief is never, at least hardly
ever, serious. How glad I am to see Judy Kean
again,&mdash;Mrs. Kent Brown! She is the same old
Judy. Such pranks as that child could play! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
shall never forget when she dyed her hair purple-black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy is a great girl. I am glad we married
into the same family,&rdquo; declared the professor.
&ldquo;But tell me, Miss Walker, how Misel is doing.
I feel quite responsible for him since it was I who
introduced him to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The students like him. He seems to be able
to impart knowledge. I am afraid he is too handsome,
however. It isn&rsquo;t quite safe to have a
professor too good-looking. College girls are
very impressionable.&rdquo; Then Miss Walker realized
she had made quite a break. Edwin Green
was certainly a very good-looking man but not
the type to make girls languish with love. While
M. Misel was a much more romantic figure with
his flashing eyes and lameness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are the girls losing their hearts to him?&rdquo;
laughed Edwin. &ldquo;Again I am thankful I am
what I am and not what others are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the two old friends chatted in the
doorway while the three veiled figures made their
way towards the village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We got them going that time,&rdquo; panted Judy
after the run through the dark. &ldquo;I bet you anything
Prexy lectures the girls to-morrow morning.
Dear Prexy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tick-tack the math teacher. I bet you
she&rsquo;s still out of bed thinking up deviltry to make
the girls miserable with on the morrow,&rdquo; suggested
Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can make a noise very muchly like a cat.
Would not that be as gruesomely as a mathematicktack?
We might be the Musicians of
Bremen, as one reads in the beautifully fairy
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine, Otoyo! Here&rsquo;s her domicile! Cut
loose!&rdquo; whispered Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the donkey
and Katherine crow like the rooster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crouched down under the window where a
light still burned for the much abused teacher of
mathematics, the Musicians of Bremen, all but
the dog, got ready for their song. The noise was
something shocking. Judy&rsquo;s bray was so lifelike
that little Otoyo sprang aside as though in fear
of kicking hind legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>A dog in the neighborhood, feeling that harmony
could be established by his voice alone,
joined in the chorus.</p>

<p>Windows were opened on the campus! Silence
reigned supreme!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t run!&rdquo; whispered Judy. &ldquo;Scrooge
down close to the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; called the math teacher.</p>

<p>Mr. Dog went on howling as though he had
been responsible for the whole infernal racket.
His timely tact seemed to satisfy the curious ones
and windows were closed, lights went out and the
campus took itself off to bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more for luck!&rdquo; commanded Great
Commander Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practice makes perfect,&rdquo; so this time the
Musicians of Bremen outdid themselves. Otoyo
made a most wonderful pussy; Maud Adams herself
could not have been a more realistic chanticler
than Katherine; and Judy&rsquo;s donkey was so
good that one could almost see the ears wagging
as her great bray made night hideous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now run before they have a chance to open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
their windows!&rdquo; and Judy was up and off in the
darkness with the two other girls close on her
heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you investigating will go on at a great
rate to-morrow,&rdquo; gasped Katherine, as after leaving
the college grounds they came to the outskirts
of the village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was so funnily,&rdquo; giggled Otoyo. &ldquo;We
must amusement make for the smally Mildred
and Cho-Cho when the to-morrow has
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I am a full-fledged teacher in
a model modern school in our great metropolis,&rdquo;
said Katherine. &ldquo;I feel just exactly like a
schoolgirl,&mdash;not even a college girl. I know I
could run a mile and there is no mischief I would
not welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tooly!&rdquo; agreed Otoyo. &ldquo;It seems but a
dream that I have honorable husband and smally
babee, Cho-Cho. I feel like badly naughtily
Japanese girl in masque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is surely great to be a boy again just
for to-night,&rdquo; declared Judy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; asked Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next will be our great adventure! This has
been only in the foothills of happenings. Soon
we will have something really great come to us,&rdquo;
encouraged the captain.</p>

<p>The village was well-lighted on the principal
street, but that the girls avoided and crept down
the side streets where all was quiet and almost
dark, except at the corners where small gas-posts
sent out feeble rays of light. They passed comfortable
homes surrounded by large yards where
the élite of Wellington lived. The élite were
evidently a well-behaved lot, as they were all
safely bestowed in bed, sleeping the sleep of the
just as our naughty girls crept in front of their
spacious mansions.</p>

<p>Next to the great, came the near great: a row
of pleasant cottages, each one with its little garden
separated from its neighbor&rsquo;s by neat whitewashed
palings. After these, they approached a
cottage set in a large yard and isolated as much
as if it were in the country. It was well back
from the street and instead of the white palings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of its neighbors, it boasted a box hedge about five
feet high and at least three feet broad. Generations
of close clipping had made this hedge as
solid as a brick wall. The yard enclosed was laid
out as a formal garden with box labyrinth and
winding paths. In the rear was a summer-house
with stone pillars covered with ivy. Two stone
benches were on each side in this quaint house
where no doubt dead and gone lovers had sat and
perhaps caught rheumatism. Box bushes were
placed at the four sides of the garden and these
had been cut to represent armchairs by some
zealous gardener long since passed away. The
modern shears had but followed the lines of the
original ones and the armchairs were still there
although somewhat lopsided and hazy in drawing.
There was the sun-dial and a snub-nosed
stone Hebe who held aloft her little pitcher with
a cup in the other hand ready to serve the Gods
with imperceptible nectar.</p>

<p>Our girls&rsquo; eyes had become accustomed to the
darkness and they peeped over the hedge (at
least Katherine and Judy did, poor little Otoyo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
was too short), plainly discerning the charming
ensemble of the little formal garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Adventure awaits us!&rdquo; said Katherine
melodramatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want muchly to see,&rdquo; pleaded Otoyo. So
Judy lifted her up for a peep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that is where the Misels live,&rdquo; said
Judy. &ldquo;It looks quite different at night, but
I&rsquo;m almost sure it is the place. Molly and I
called at dusk and we came up on the other side,
but I think it is this cottage. Isn&rsquo;t it lovely? I
am so sorry for them, they do seem so friendless,
somehow. Madame is already working for the
Red Cross. Molly says she can make surgical
dressings faster than anybody she ever saw. She
takes them home and does them and brings them
back so neatly folded and tied up that they think
it is perfect foolishness to inspect them. They
are sure there will be no mistakes where such a
careful worker is on the job. M. Misel is so
lame he can hardly locomote.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in their garden and sit down a little
while,&rdquo; suggested Katherine, who but a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
before had declared she could run a mile.
The sedentary life as a teacher had not improved
her wind. Her spirits might have been those of
a schoolgirl but her endurance was equal only to
a full-fledged teacher in a model school.</p>

<p>They passed through the small green turnstile
and silently crept around the labyrinth to the
summer-house. The three girls sank on one of
the cold stone benches and peered out into the
picturesque garden. Their veils were raised but
ready to be pulled down at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghosts might walk in such a garden,&rdquo; whispered
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bench is coldly like a ghost,&rdquo; shivered
Otoyo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>AS SEEN FROM THE SUMMER-HOUSE</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;And now, Adventure, come forth!&rdquo; commanded
Katherine in sepulchral tones.</p>

<p>The side door of the cottage, leading to the
garden, now opened as though at Katherine&rsquo;s orders,
and a broad ribbon of light fell across the
labyrinth, picking out the snub-nosed Hebe and
the sun-dial and one of the box chairs to illuminate.
A man&rsquo;s figure was silhouetted in the
doorway, a figure so beautiful that the artist in
Judy gasped. He had on running togs which
exposed his clean-cut limbs and shapely shoulders.
A woman stood beside him and Judy recognized
the outline of Madame Misel. The
Greek god of a man was strange to her, although
there was something familiar about the poise of
his head on its column-like neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman spoke in German in a low clear
voice. Judy and Katherine both knew German
fairly well and Otoyo had some knowledge of it.
They heard Madame Misel say distinctly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wiser if you wait until midnight for the
exercises. Some of these blockheads might be
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, absurd!&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;There is
no one in this whole stupid place with the spirit to
be from under cover after ten. I am cramped
enough and must run and leap. Stand aside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misel, himself!&rdquo; gasped Judy. Where were
his crutch and cane and his lame back?</p>

<p>The girls sat as still as the stone Hebe. It was
inky black in their corner of the summer-house
where they cowered, not afraid at all but ready to
knock the chip from the shoulder of Adventure.
Judy&rsquo;s first instinct on recognizing Madame
Misel was to make herself known and explain
their presence in her garden at such a late hour,
but the realization that Misel was the man in running
togs, which usually means running, glued
her to her bench. What did it all mean?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The door was shut and then Misel began a
series of exercises of which any circus actor might
have been proud. He began by leaping over the
clipped hedge of the labyrinth,&mdash;back and forth
with most surprising gyrations. It was so dark
that it was difficult to follow his every movement,
and so rapid were his leaps and bounds that he
was now here, now there before eyes could be focussed
to take in the impression. Then almost
without the girls realizing what had happened, he
had cleared the five-foot hedge and was out on
the deserted street running like a deer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, before he is back!&rdquo; gasped Judy, and
the seekers for sensations were out of the garden
and through the little turnstile in not much more
time than it had taken the master of the house to
leap the hedge.</p>

<p>Without a word they hastened back to the college
grounds. As they turned a corner, they ran
plump into Misel, who seemed to have let off
steam enough to be trotting contentedly home.
They need not have feared him. He was much
more anxious to escape from them than they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
from him. He turned and ran like the wind in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I wish we could have tripped him up!&rdquo;
exclaimed Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I might have jiu jitsued him most neatlily,&rdquo;
put in little Otoyo. &ldquo;I think he is what
you might call a traitor-r-r.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was never more excited in my life. What
will the girls think when we tell them of what has
happened to us?&rdquo; panted Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you realize we have run against a tremendous
thing?&rdquo; said Judy soberly. &ldquo;Almost international
importance! I fancy we must keep
kind of quiet about it. Of course we will tell
Molly and Edwin and the girls, but I have an
idea this thing will have to be worked up slowly
and cautiously. I bet you it will be a case of secret
service men and enemy aliens and what not.
Why should Misel have pretended to be lame?
Why should they come to live at Wellington?
Why&mdash;a million whys about the whole matter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing:&mdash;Misel thought we were college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
girls on a lark and he will have no fear of our saying
we met him or anyone outside the campus at
such an hour,&rdquo; said Katherine wisely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE PROFESSOR AT A KIMONO PARTY</small></h2>


<p>The Welsh rarebit was just assuming its required
thickness and smoothness and the toast
was done to a turn ready to receive its libation of
cheese, when the wanderers came pattering in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Edwin?&rdquo; demanded Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his den! You see this is a kimono party
and gentlemen are not admitted,&rdquo; said Molly,
helping Judy off with her coat and veil. &ldquo;Now
tell us all about it! Something has happened, I
can see by your eyes and hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happened! I should say it has! Something
has bounced! Call Edwin! I don&rsquo;t give a hang
if we are in kimonos! I&rsquo;ll be bound he does not
know a kimono from a ball gown&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell it
twice.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Otoyo and I are not dumb. We might help
out when you fall by the wayside,&rdquo; laughed Katherine,
&ldquo;but I, for one, don&rsquo;t mind the professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I! Nor I!&rdquo; chorused the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think mine is vastly becoming,&rdquo; Jessie whispered
to Margaret, who called her a vain puss.</p>

<p>Edwin came in, rather pleased at being admitted
and being allowed to have some of the
party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never expected to get in on a fudge party,&rdquo;
he said, contentedly settling himself by Judy,
who was bursting with news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now begin!&rdquo; commanded Margaret, rapping
for order in much the old manner of class
president and presiding officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begin at the beginning!&rdquo; begged Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, first we went by Prexy&rsquo;s, just to get
the feeling of youth back in our veins. She saw
us, but we chased by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it was you! I wish I had run you down,&rdquo;
cried the brother-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a blessing you did not or a good story
would have been ruined,&rdquo; said Katherine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret rapped for order and Judy took up
the tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we went to call on Mattie Math. She
was burning the midnight oil, at least the 10 <span class="smcap">p.&nbsp;m.</span>
oil, and when we acted the Musicians of Bremen,
she threw up the sash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hash? What hash?&rdquo; asked Jessie, who
often arrived a bit late. Shrieks and more rappings
from Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, how much I have missed in never being
asked to a kimono party before,&rdquo; whispered the
male guest in Judy&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After we had brayed and crowed and
meouwed and a dog had barked for us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All together!&rdquo; cried Katherine, and the musicians
gave a sample of their performance, Mrs.
Matsuki outdoing all cats by her lifelike caterwauling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that, we went silently down to the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, not silently!&rdquo; asserted Edwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No interruptions from the minority! We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
went silently down to the village, veils down,
steps stealthy, eyes open and mouths shut. The
garden at the Misels&rsquo; was most inviting in its
sweetness and beauty. Of course we wanted to
go in and rest on the nice warm stone benches, so
we walked through the turnstile and seated ourselves
in the little dark summer-house, there to
await Adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bang! Adventure comes stalkingly in!&rdquo;
cried Otoyo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaping was more like it!&rdquo; from Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Who should come springing from the
side door, totally oblivious of us, but Misel,
stripped for running and looking like a detail
from a Greek frieze!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Misel! Why, Judy, you are mad!
Misel is so lame he can&rsquo;t stand alone without
crutch and cane!&rdquo; cried Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lame your grandmother! He is a perfect
circus actor. I have never seen a private citizen
with such control of his muscles. He actually
turned somersaults over the hedge in the labyrinth,
walked on his hands better than I can on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
my feet, and cleared the five-foot hedge that borders
the street with as much ease as&mdash;as&mdash;I eat
this fudge,&rdquo; reaching for another piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Judy, are you sure it was he?&rdquo; asked
Edwin excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am sure!&rdquo; And then Judy repeated
the conversation they had overheard between
Misel and his wife. &ldquo;My German is shady
when I have to use it, but I can understand very
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So can I,&rdquo; declared Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And while I am constructionally verily faultily,
I comprehend can,&rdquo; said Otoyo, so excited
that she ran off to adverb forms as was her wont
in times of stress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is serious,&rdquo; said Edwin solemnly. &ldquo;So
serious that I feel I must do something about it
and do it immediately. What time is it, honey?&rdquo;
he asked Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eleven-fifty! Why, what can you do? Not
go fight Misel&mdash;not that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not that, at least not that yet, although I
should like to break his lying crutch over his traitorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
head. I must get in touch with the Secret
Service. War will be declared any day now and
Germany is getting busy even in quiet Wellington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget Exmoor College is so near,&rdquo; put
in Margaret. &ldquo;Our college boys will officer the
new army in part. I&rsquo;ll wager anything that this
man has already begun his pacifist propaganda
here in Wellington and at Exmoor, too. Has he
been to Exmoor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly! He got me to take him
over and introduce him, the beast!&rdquo; stormed Edwin.
&ldquo;Please pack my little grip for me, honey,&rdquo;
he asked, drawing Molly to him. &ldquo;I can catch
the twelve-forty to New York. Don&rsquo;t give out
that I am away. We had better do a little camouflage
act of our own. I am ill, very ill! That
will do! Let it be&mdash;what shall it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mumps!&rdquo; cried Edith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not mumps, please!&rdquo; cried Jessie. &ldquo;Nothing
contagious or we might catch it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or worse than that, even, be quarantined!&rdquo;
laughed Nance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty hard on you, honey, as it would stop
the ceremony,&rdquo; suggested Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you usually have when you have
anything?&rdquo; asked Margaret with her judicial
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neuralgia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then neuralgia would be the natural thing to
have when you have not anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! Then, Molly, all day to-morrow
your poor husband is ill with neuralgia. Not
even the servants and children must come in my
darkened room. I&rsquo;ll be home in the night and
wake up the next morning feeling much better,&rdquo;
and Molly hurried off to pack the grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In time to give the bride away!&rdquo; suggested
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I tell Andy all about it?&rdquo; asked Nance
shyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! We would not be so cruel as to
make you start out with a secret from your lord
and master,&rdquo; said Edwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes me so mad to think how kind Andy
was to that man, offering his medical services to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
him and what not. I know the brutes had a good
laugh over his gullibility. Andy told me afterwards
that he could not understand the case, and
if the man wasn&rsquo;t shamming, it was the most peculiar
thing he had ever seen: the way he jumped
up out of his chair when he was so lame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I remember that very night that I heard
Madame Misel call her husband a fool on the way
into the dining-room. I had forgotten all about
it until this minute. I kept wondering what she
meant,&rdquo; said Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you they are deep ones,&rdquo; put in Katherine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; stormed Judy. &ldquo;They are
the worst of all fools because they think no one
else has any sense. Bobby, my beloved parent,
always says that is the worst kind of fool. That
the wise man, who wants to put over anything,
must go to work with the idea that all the persons
he wants the scheme to get by with have as much
and more sense than he has. Now these Huns
think they are the only pebbles on the beach and
take for granted that they are dealing with children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and fools, and as a rule they get caught up
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before they do lots of damage, however,&rdquo;
said Nance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope in this instance their machinations
have not done any,&rdquo; said Edwin devoutly. &ldquo;Be
sure and give the Misels no inkling they are suspected.
All of you remember to be as polite as
usual to them if you happen to run across
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, but it will surely go against the
grain,&rdquo; said Judy, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prove your father&rsquo;s statements, dear little
sister, and we shall let these foreigners know that
we are not the blockheads they call us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also we are not the sleepily heads that must
go bedwardly at such earlyly hour,&rdquo; and little
Otoyo opened her almond eyes very wide to show
that she at least would neither slumber nor sleep
until the enemies to her country and her adopted
country were safely caught up with.</p>

<p>Molly came in with the grip packed. Some
fudge was tucked in to help out his journey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Edwin, with the warm wishes of the kimono
party, started on his patriotic travels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember to let Prexy know I am almost
dead with neuralgia and do not let a soul but
Andy on to the fact that I am off on a journey.
I&rsquo;ll creep in to-morrow night. Keep your eyes
open for deviltries that the Misels may be up to,
but don&rsquo;t let them know you are not the dummies
they think you. They will not be classed as alien
enemies until war is formally declared, and that
will be day after to-morrow, according to the
latest news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance was quietly stitching while most of the
above conversation was going on, but her
thoughts were very busy. The idea that was uppermost
in her mind was that the day United
States was to form an alliance with the nations,
she was to form one equally strong with her
Andy.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>WAR RELIEF</small></h2>


<p>Edwin Green occasionally had an attack of
neuralgia that incapacitated him for work for at
least a day, so when Molly solemnly gave out the
news that her poor husband was suffering with
one of his spells of that painful malady, sympathy
was expressed by servants, teachers, and
students. Blinds in the invalid&rsquo;s room were carefully
closed and the door locked, with the key in
Molly&rsquo;s pocket. Instructions were sternly given
that nobody must disturb him. When he felt
better he would ask for what he wanted. Little
Mildred was very sad that she was not allowed to
take him his &ldquo;tup of toffee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I weckon he&rsquo;s a-gonter die, sho,&rdquo; she confided
to Cho-Cho-San. &ldquo;Only my mother don&rsquo;t know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it or she wouldn&rsquo;t be a-smilin&rsquo; an&rsquo; laughin&rsquo; so
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to work this morning at my war
relief, even if we are to get married to-morrow,&rdquo;
declared Molly at breakfast. &ldquo;If I let anything
short of death interfere I get into bad habits, and
the work simply must be done. They are crying
out for more and more dressings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all of us go help! We can turn out
oodlums of work if we try,&rdquo; cried Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Nance!&rdquo; insisted Molly. &ldquo;I know she
has a lot of little stitches to put in before to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me, I will beg off,&rdquo;
blushed Nance. &ldquo;Andy is coming in this morning
for a few moments, besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, you must stay at home to take care
of poor dear Edwin,&rdquo; laughed Judy. &ldquo;It
would look terribly heartless for all of us to go
leave him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot Edwin!&rdquo; declared Molly, just
as Kizzie came in with a stack of waffles. The
girl looked at her mistress in astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
What was coming over her Miss Molly, &ldquo;fergittin&rsquo;
of the boss and then a-larfin&rsquo; about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I take Andy up to see him?&rdquo; asked
Nance soberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better take the kids along so their
noise won&rsquo;t disturb poor dear Brother Edwin?&rdquo;
suggested Judy, &ldquo;Mildred and Cho-Cho and
Poilu, the puppy.&rdquo; Poilu was a diminutive mongrel,
the love of Mildred&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, please, please!&rdquo; begged Mildred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee! I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee!&rdquo; sang Cho-Cho
as Molly smiled her consent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can play in the churchyard and will be
good, I am sure,&rdquo; she declared.</p>

<p>And so Nance was left to put in her finishing
stitches, to receive her lover and to take care of
the fictitious case of neuralgia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot cloths on his head if he is in very great
agony,&rdquo; Molly called back as the gay throng
started for the war relief rooms. &ldquo;There is more
aspirin in the top drawer if he is in much pain.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Nance had a busy morning answering the
&rsquo;phone, which rang many times with inquiries for
the popular professor. Mary Neil sent a box of
candy to Molly as a kind of consolation prize and
Billie McKym sent Edwin a pot of flowers.
Lilian Swift sent a basket of fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If their friends rally around them so for an
imaginary disease, what would they do if something
were really the matter?&rdquo; thought Nance.</p>

<p>M. Misel and Andy met at the front door,
Misel to inquire for the poor ill man and Andy to
catch a glimpse of his Nance. Misel had walked
slowly and painfully across the campus from his
class room. Nance, from the window, had
watched him approaching and she could but admire
his patience as he made his crippled way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be worse to have to pretend to be
lame than to be lame,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I
wonder if Andy is still fooled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men came into the library together,
Andy showing great solicitude for the disabled
foreigner. Misel was so extremely polite and
seemed so distressed at Edwin&rsquo;s illness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Nance could hardly believe that Judy and the
girls could be right in the discovery they had
made the night before. His manner was perfect,
so respectful, so kindly and courteous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I am to wish you joy, Dr. McLean,&mdash;and
I do so with all my heart.&rdquo; Andy grinned
his appreciation. &ldquo;My wife and I were quite
charmed by Miss Oldham. I hear you are to go
to the front to assist poor stricken France. I
admire the courage of your fiancée to contemplate
going with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would take more for me to stay away,&rdquo;
whispered Nance softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it is the spirit of the women which is what
the Germans have to fight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not the spirit of the German women quite
as courageous as ours?&rdquo; asked Nance, looking at
Misel keenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! <cite>Wonderschön!&rdquo;</cite> his eyes glowed. Suddenly
the fact that he had dropped into German
seemed to embarrass him. &ldquo;That is&mdash;that is the
word for the German women, just as &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo;
is the one for the Americans.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about Edwin,&rdquo; interrupted Andy, as
though he meant to put Misel at his ease again.
&ldquo;Is he very ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go up to see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly said he was not to be disturbed. These
headaches just wear themselves out. He will be
all right to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is something to be done before it
wears Edwin out as well as itself,&rdquo; insisted the
young doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly says not!&rdquo; Nance shook her head at
Andy as much as to tell him he was talking too
much, and that young man subsided until Misel
had gone. Then Nance revealed to her lover the
whole nefarious plot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had my doubts about that man from the
first. I could not see how anyone as lame as he
was could have jumped up so briskly. The
beast! How could you be so polite to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Camouflage! Fighting the devil with fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad old Ed took matters in hand so
promptly. I tell you these college professors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
show up pretty well in these times! Wilson and
Green forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime the industrious war relief
workers were hard at it. The be-aproned and
be-kerchiefed ladies of Wellington held their
séances in the basement of the little church. It
was astonishing how large was their output, but
busy fingers had been steadily at work ever since
word had come from France that wounded men
were dying for lack of surgical dressings, and
that word had come very soon after the breaking
out of the World War.</p>

<p>Women with earnest faces were bending over
the long tables, some rolling bandages; some tearing
cotton cloth; some pulling threads for careful
cutting of gauze, later to be deftly folded in the
prescribed shape. In one corner, cotton batting
was being fluffed up for the making of fracture
pillows. Huge baskets were being emptied by
one group as they stuffed the pillows, while
others were being filled by the fluffers, as Judy
called the women whose duty it was to pick the
cotton. Much sneezing went on in this corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and he who wonders why, might try once fluffing
unrefined cotton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me make the tampons!&rdquo; begged Jessie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know why! Because they look like powder
puffs,&rdquo; teased Edith.</p>

<p>The house party was received with enthusiasm
by the Wellington workers. There always seems
to be more work than can be accomplished and
then workers come and by hook or crook the task
is completed. All of our girls had done some
war relief work, so it was easy to set them to their
stints. Pretty Jessie could make tampons that
were so soft and so regular that they really did
look like powder puffs. Katherine could pick
cotton as fast as Mother Carey can chickens and
her advent caused an increase of sneezing. Edith
stuffed fracture pillows just to show that she
could go faster than her sister. Margaret rolled
bandages with a precision equal to her parliamentary
ruling when she was presiding officer.
Otoyo and Judy and Molly folded the gauze into
the neat little six-inch squares. This is the most
difficult part of the work, requiring such accuracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that only the expert should choose that table.
The edges must come just together, no threads
must be left on the gauze, the corners must be
turned under exactly enough and the finished articles
stacked in even piles.</p>

<p>Madame Misel came in with the work she had
taken home to finish. Never were such neat,
wonderful dressings as hers. In the short time
she had been at Wellington she had accomplished
the work of two women, bringing in great stacks
of the accurately-made dressings.</p>

<p>It was difficult for the girls to treat her with
the courtesy they knew it was policy to employ.
Behind that calm mask they could now detect the
lying spy. Her expression was as demure as
ever and she spoke with the same hesitation that
they felt was assumed, just as her husband&rsquo;s halting
gait was. Why they should have taken up
that particular disguise, Molly and her friends
were at a loss to know.</p>

<p>Madame Misel was almost a beautiful woman.
Animation would have made her quite beautiful,
animation and better dressing. Her hair was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
parted in the middle and brushed as slick as glass,
coiled in a tight knob at exactly the wrong angle.
She habitually wore an old-fashioned basque of a
bygone cut buttoned up close to the neck with a
narrow band of white collar, which but accentuated
the severity of her garb. Her shoes were
broad and ugly with no heels, her skirt skimpy
and badly hung.</p>

<p>Judy studied the countenance of the foreigner
as she bent over her work. The nimble fingers
moved very rapidly as she folded the gauze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;d like to sketch her!&rdquo; Judy whispered
to Molly. &ldquo;A mixture of Mona Lisa and
the Unknown Woman and plain repressed
devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She whipped out her sketch book, which was
never far from her, and with a few strokes had
Madame Misel&rsquo;s pose, then with a skill that was
quite wonderful had suggested her features. The
model moved uneasily as though conscious of
scrutiny, but before she looked up Judy had
closed her book and was demurely folding gauze.
Madame arose and walked away, standing by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
table where Margaret was rolling bandages.
Judy again whipped out her book and made a
rapid impression of the unstylish figure in its flat
shoes and tight basque.</p>

<p>Just then little Mildred and Cho-Cho came
screaming from the churchyard where they had
been playing happily. Mildred had in her arms
the poor little much-petted puppy. Blood was
streaming from the creature&rsquo;s leg and he was giving
forth pathetic wails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A big dog done bitted him all up!&rdquo; cried
Mildred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greatly dog &rsquo;ave &rsquo;urt little puppee!&rdquo; said
Cho-Cho-San.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First aid to the injured!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy,
as she took the bleeding canine in her arms. The
pile of beautifully made dressings Madame Misel
had just brought in was on the corner of the long
table. Without a by-your-leave, Judy snatched
up one from the top and bound it around the poor
gory leg. &ldquo;There, you poor little precious!
You may be part French poodle, anyhow, and
surely a wound is a wound.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Misel put out a hand as though to
stay her, but before she could say anything Judy
had the dressing wrapped around the puppy&rsquo;s
little leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bad to take one so perfectly made, but I
just grabbed the one closest to hand. Now, Mildred,
you and Cho-Cho can be Red Cross nurses
and little Poilu can be your wounded warrior.
Take him out and nurse him carefully. It isn&rsquo;t
much of a place and no doubt with good care he
will be all well by to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;it&mdash;would be&mdash;advisable to&mdash;apply&mdash;iodine
to the wound&mdash;is it&mdash;not so, Madame
Brown? I shall be pleased to&mdash;go to&mdash;my&mdash;house&mdash;and&mdash;procure
some,&rdquo; faltered Madame
Misel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is really necessary,&rdquo; insisted
Molly. &ldquo;We shall be going home presently and
I can put some on then. You are very kind.&rdquo;
Enemy alien or not, Madame Misel was certainly
very thoughtful to want to take the trouble for
the pet. Molly, ever ready to see the good in
persons, had a feeling that this quiet, pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
woman could not be shamming. Perhaps Misel
was not what he should be, but not this wife, who
was so untiring in her labors of mercy.</p>

<p>When they started home, the roly-poly Poilu
seemed to have recovered entirely. He did not
even limp, so he was spared the ordeal of having
the stinging iodine poured on the wounded leg.
It was nothing more than a scratch anyhow, Judy
declared.</p>

<p>At midnight Edwin returned, letting himself
quietly in the front door. Molly was waiting for
him, eaten up with curiosity about what had
transpired. He had been closeted with the Secret
Service officials, who considered the matter
of the gravest importance. Two of the cleverest
and most cautious of the detective force were put
on the job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were no doubt on the train with me,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but I have no idea what they look like
or what disguise they themselves will employ. At
least a dozen persons got off the train at Wellington
Station and all of them or none of them may
have been Sherlock Holmeses.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your neuralgia is better,&rdquo; laughed
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the joke of it is, I really did have neuralgia
all day, not severe enough to keep me from
enjoying a very good luncheon with your brother
Kent and Jimmie Lufton at the Press Club, but
quite bad enough to keep you from having told
a lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor dear! I am so sorry for you to have
suffered at all, but it is certainly considerate of
you to be instrumental in saving my soul. And
now, since to-morrow is the wedding day, we had
better get all the sleep we can.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>TILL DEATH DOTH US PART</small></h2>


<p>The small home wedding that Nance and
Molly had originally planned grew to be quite
large. Little by little it seemed impossible to get
married without first one person and then the
other. Andy had many friends at Exmoor and
Wellington; Dr. and Mrs. McLean knew half
the country and had a long list to be invited;
Nance wanted the whole faculty and some of the
girls who were favorites of Molly&rsquo;s; Kent Brown
arrived from New York bringing with him Mr.
Matsuki, frankly delighted to be included in so
honorable an assemblage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely they can&rsquo;t all of them sleep here,&rdquo; said
Edwin to his wife as he put on his wedding garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can, but they won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
laughing at his woeful expression. &ldquo;The house
party breaks up after the ceremony. Do I look
all right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean my dress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I mean you! I don&rsquo;t know anything
about your dress except that it is blue as it should
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you find your collar buttons and is your
tie all right?&rdquo; asked the anxious housewife as she
accepted with very good grace the embrace Edwin
felt was necessary to his happiness just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Everything O.&nbsp;K.! I am sorry for
the bride because you are so lovely, honey.
Nance is a pretty girl but I am afraid nobody will
see her because of the matron of honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a goose! Now I must go look after the
flower girls. Katy has them coralled in the
nursery where they can&rsquo;t get dirty. They are
the sweetest looking creatures you ever saw in
your life. Dodo looks like a beautiful cabbage
rose himself, his cheeks are so rosy. I wish
Mother could see him.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she come on to the wedding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sue needs her in Kentucky. The only trouble
about Mother is that there is only one of her.
I need her more than anything right now. If she
were here she would take hold of this wedding
breakfast and I would know it would come off
right,&rdquo; sighed Molly, who, true to her character,
had planned to do enough for two persons.
&ldquo;Thank goodness, Judy is here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ceremony was to be at twelve and then a
wedding breakfast served. This meant Molly
was to be very busy. The girls were helping, but
at the same time they were more or less flustered
trying to get themselves dressed all in one room.
They had determined to make this a gay light
wedding as to clothes at least. There was a feeling
of excitement in every breast, excitement
mingled with sadness. Was not this the most momentous
day in the life of every true American?
War was declared! Perhaps had they realized
just what war meant, those girls could not have
donned those gay, bright garments. Would they
have had the courage to wish their friend God-speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
so cheerily? I believe they would. They
were of the stuff of the mothers of men. On that
second of April, 1917, every woman in the United
States must have felt somewhat as Molly Brown&rsquo;s
college friends felt. It was a feeling of excitement,
awe, exhilaration and dread combined.</p>

<p>Nance was gowned in white with a wonderful
lace veil Otoyo had brought as her present. It
was as filmy as the clouds that rest on Fujiyama,
the sacred mountain of Otoyo&rsquo;s country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only suppose she had brought a tea basket
like mine! What would that have looked like on
your head?&rdquo; giggled Judy, who was in a
strangely hysterical state. She was one girl who
very well knew what the war was to mean. Had
she not been on the outskirts of war in 1914 when
she was stranded in Paris? Had she not seen the
soldiers marching off bidding farewell to their
nearest and dearest,&mdash;sometimes a final farewell?
Kent had spent all the time he could in training
camps since they had been opened to citizens of
the United States, and now he was confident of
receiving a commission. Perhaps it would mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that her husband would be in the trenches in a
short time. She wanted him to want to go, was
proud of him for wanting to,&mdash;but oh, the agony
of it all!</p>

<p>Almost time for the ceremony now! Molly
made her final tour of inspection. Edwin, Kent
and Mr. Matsuki were safe in the den where they
eagerly discussed politics. Dr. and Mrs. McLean
arrived, holding Andy between them as
though they might lose him before it was time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant to help you, Molly, child, but my
hea-r-r-t is so joompy I am afraid it will be best
for me to compose meself,&rdquo; said the poor mother.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Andy know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly kissed the dear lady and asked Katherine
to stay near her. Katherine&rsquo;s dressing was
always a simple matter, as her gowns consisted of
shirt-waists and skirts in various materials to
suit various occasions. She declared she could
dress in the dark and look just as well as
though she had had cheval glasses and a blaze of
light.</p>

<p>The other girls were ready and came down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the parlors to help receive the guests. Nance
was lovely and looked as fresh and sweet as a
white violet as she sat in her room sedately
awaiting the hour. A visit to the nursery disclosed
the children piously standing with backs
to the window and arms held well away from
their fluffy skirts, as charming flower girls as one
could find.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee! I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee! I&rsquo;m Mildred&rsquo;s
Japanese dollee! She&rsquo;s my kick-up dollee!&rdquo;
sang the little Cho-Cho-San. &ldquo;All I
want is bald spot, and all she wants is stick up
hair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we your little comforts, Muvver?&rdquo;
asked Mildred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed you are, my darling! Now when
Judy calls, you come running so you can go
down the stairs in front of Aunt Nance. Judy
will have your wreaths all ready. Where is
Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s peeking at the comply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you kiddies be good and don&rsquo;t get
your dresses mussed. It is almost time now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Don&rsquo;t wake Dodo.&rdquo; Of course Dodo had gone
to sleep, since there was nothing more important
on hand just then. Molly hurried off to the
kitchen to see that the wedding breakfast was
coming on as she had planned. Mrs. Murphy
had hobbled up to help Kizzie, and Mrs. McLean
had sent over her two maids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All they need is a boss,&rdquo; sighed poor Molly.
&ldquo;If I only could be two places at one time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But whose familiar figure was that seen
through the scullery door? The maids were all
in a broad grin and Kizzie, as she expressed it,
&ldquo;was fittin&rsquo; to bust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother! Mother! Where on earth did you
come from?&rdquo; and Molly had that dear lady
clasped in her arms. &ldquo;What are you doing in
the back? Come on and hurry and get dressed!
It is almost time!&rdquo; Molly felt like little Cho-Cho
when she cried out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so &rsquo;appee! I&rsquo;m so
&rsquo;appee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just this minute arrived and have no idea
of dressing!&rdquo; cried that dear lady when she could
speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you needn&rsquo;t dress! You are lovely
as you are&mdash;your hair is a bit mussed&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mussed it but it will do very well for the
part I am to play. I have no idea of appearing.
I mean to serve this breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, I couldn&rsquo;t let you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! That is what I hurried on for.
Why, child, when I realized that you were having
a house party and a wedding and going to serve a
great breakfast, I simply jumped on the train
with a hand-bag and flew to you. You always
have behaved as though you were triplets. Now
run along and don&rsquo;t tell a soul I am here. I can
be honored later on; now I want a big apron and
room to operate. Kizzie has already told me
what the breakfast is to be and you need not
think about it. Run along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one more hug and I am gone. Aren&rsquo;t
you even going to peek at the comply, as Mildred
says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll see the ceremony, never fear; but fly,
Molly! The guests are coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly felt as though she really could fly. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
mother&rsquo;s arrival had relieved her of all fear about
the wedding breakfast. It would be obliged to
go off without a hitch now. Dear, dear Mother!
How like her to come quietly slipping in the back
way just in the nick of time!</p>

<p>One could have heard a pin drop in the old
square house on the campus as the first strains of
the wedding march arose and the rustle of skirts
on the stairway announced the approach of the
wedding procession. Andy was shaking and
shivering in the hall, tightly clutching his father&rsquo;s
arm. He had declared that Dr. McLean must
be his best man and would hear of no other. Of
course he was just as scared as the groom always
is, at least, all proper grooms.</p>

<p>At Judy&rsquo;s signal the little flower girls came
dancing from the nursery, their fluffy skirts flying.
The wreaths and garlands were handed
them and they marched down the stairs feeling
much more important than Nance herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; thought Molly as she followed
them with Nance, &ldquo;what on earth is the matter
with Mildred&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo; It was standing up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
most peculiar way. Instead of the curls that
Katy had so carefully made, her ringlets had
been brushed out and Molly realized that at least
four inches of her daughter&rsquo;s hair had been cut
off. &ldquo;And Cho-Cho-San! What has happened
to her?&rdquo; In the middle of the child&rsquo;s head was a
bare spot at least three inches in diameter. It
looked as though it had been shaved.</p>

<p>Whatever the matter was, it affected the
flower girls not in the least. With many tosses
of those shorn heads they marched into the parlor,
scattering their posies as they had been told.
When Otoyo saw the bald spot on the head of her
offspring she almost fainted and had to hold on
to the ready arm of honorable husband. Cho-Cho-San
had clipped Mildred&rsquo;s hair to make it
stand up like a kick-up dolly, and Mildred had
stolen her father&rsquo;s safety razor and converted her
little friend into a veritable Japanese dolly.</p>

<p>Nothing but the solemnity of the occasion kept
Molly from hysterics. The little wretches must
have got busy after she made her visit to the
nursery. Evidently they were doing what Mildred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
called &ldquo;playing true.&rdquo; Cho-Cho was a
Japanese dolly and Mildred was a kick-up. The
little visitor did look exactly like one of those fascinating
Japanese dolls, and Molly could but
smile in spite of her distress. She was afraid to
catch Judy&rsquo;s eye as she stepped back to let Andy
take his place by Nance&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Never had the wedding ceremony seemed so
impressive as on that second of April. Every
mind was filled with the importance of the step
that the country was taking, and with the prayer
that Andy and Nance would prosper, was
breathed the thought that the United States
might come out victorious.</p>

<p>Nance was to go with Andy&rsquo;s unit in the capacity
of interpreter. She was not a brilliant
French scholar but was thorough in her knowledge
of that as of everything she had undertaken.
She frankly declared that she had been separated
from Andy long enough and she intended to follow
him to the ends of the earth if need be. It
was that wonderful fact that made Andy&rsquo;s &ldquo;I
will!&rdquo; so strong and clear. His tremblings left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
him and he stood by his dear girl like the soldier
of the Red Cross that he was. Nothing was impossible
or too hard if Nance was to be with him.</p>

<p>Mrs. McLean&rsquo;s good, honest face was like an
angel&rsquo;s as she gazed on her new daughter-in-law.
No jealousy was depicted there&mdash;nothing but
adoration, gratitude that the girl was to make her
Andy happy. Poor Dr. McLean was sobbing
like a baby and his good wife had to put her arms
around him to comfort him.</p>

<p>All over! &ldquo;Whom God hath joined together
let no man put asunder.&rdquo; Andy clasped his
Nance with the look of: &ldquo;I dare anyone to try!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otoyo and Molly held a whispered consultation
over their imaginative offspring and decided
that nothing was to be said or done to the
culprits on that day of days,&mdash;the reckoning
must be deferred.</p>

<p>Those infants were greatly astonished, somewhat
relieved and secretly chagrined that their
prank was not noticed. They had expected to be
even more important than the bride in their rôles
of Japanese and kick-up dolls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I weckon nobody don&rsquo;t love us &rsquo;nough to
spank us even,&rdquo; pouted Mildred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Japanese babee gets not spank-ed&mdash;but honorable
mother frowns on Cho-Cho when she
loves her most after naughtiness&mdash;but now&mdash;but
now&mdash;she smiles, but not with love,&rdquo; was the wail
of the companion in crime and misery.</p>

<p>The efficient helmsman in the kitchen steered
the wedding breakfast to safety. The affair
went off with such expedition that the housekeepers
present marveled at Molly&rsquo;s cleverness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have trained her servants wonderfully
well,&rdquo; whispered one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember the joke they got off on Molly
in college,&rdquo; laughed Miss Walker. &ldquo;It was that
she came of a family of famous cooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not only the cooking now,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Fern, Edwin&rsquo;s cousin and the mother of the perfect
Alice. &ldquo;It is the way it is served and the
orderliness of the waitresses. I wonder that
Molly can be with her guests while it is being
done unless she has had a caterer come up from
New York. I simply have to be in the pantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
myself when my daughters entertain on a large
scale. That is, unless I can hire someone to come
take charge, and Wellington does not boast such
a person. Alice is very particular but not willing
to do much herself,&mdash;not able, in fact,&rdquo; she added
lamely, a little afraid of having criticized her perfect
daughter in public.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fern was very fond of Molly and admired
her greatly in spite of the fact that she
could not help bearing her a tiny secret grudge
for marrying Edwin Green. That good lady
had in her heart of hearts hoped that Alice was
to bear off the professional prize. Perfect persons
are not always very pleasant to live with and
Alice Fern was no exception to the rule. Mrs.
Fern wished no harm to Edwin but she would
have been glad to shift her burden of perfectness
to other shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are just asking ourselves how you do it,
my dear,&rdquo; she said as Molly came up to see that
all was going well with her guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it! I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret that I was not
to divulge but I am simply bursting with it:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Mother is in the pantry! She came in the back
way, without my even knowing she had left Kentucky,
and now she is directing operations. She
refuses to appear until the party is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is the reason for that glow in your
eyes!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Walker. &ldquo;I used to say
when you were a college girl that I could tell by
your expression when the western mail had
brought you a letter from Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it showed so,&rdquo; blushed Molly,
&ldquo;but it does make me feel warm all over when I
know my mother is near.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE PUNISHMENT OF MILDRED</small></h2>


<p>The last rice thrown and the bridal party
gone! Molly and Judy all that was left of the
gay girls! The old crowd once more dispersed!
I wonder if they will ever come together again.
It had been a perfect time, and Molly, although
dead tired, was very happy that she had been
able to gather them in under her roof. All that
worried her now was the fact that Mildred was
to be punished. How, she was not certain.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown, no longer in her apron but now
the most honored of all, was ensconced on the
sofa with Dodo in her arms and Mildred snuggled
up close to her side. The child&rsquo;s eyes were
big and sad. Her little cropped head was drooping
and her mouth trembling. Even Granny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
was not noticing her naughtiness. Evidently nobody
loved her!</p>

<p>Kent was seated on the floor, his head against
his mother&rsquo;s knee, where, without exerting himself,
he could see Judy&rsquo;s animated face and
bright fluffy hair. Perhaps the time was soon
coming when he would have to be far away from
these beloved women. He was sure of his commission
now and was ready for his country&rsquo;s call,
but oh, it was hard to be uprooted from the pleasant
spot where love had planted him! Ah, well!
The war could not last forever and maybe there
was a good time coming for all of them. It was
hard to leave Judy, but it would be harder to take
her with him if duty sent him to France. He did
not criticize Andy McLean in the least. He
knew his own business and Nance wanted to go
with him but he, Kent Brown, had no idea of
exposing his Judy to any more horrors of war.
The taste both of them had had of it was enough.</p>

<p>The little group around the fire was very quiet.
Dormouse Dodo went off into his usual soporific
state. Judy was knitting rapidly, and the click<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of her needles was all that broke the stillness.
Judy always declared she did not mind knitting
if she could just make her needles click. Molly
was too tired to knit, too tired to do anything. If
only she had settled matters with her first born!
Her conscience told her it must be done and done
soon. If only something would happen to keep
her from having to do it, whatever it was to be.
She actually prayed for strength to take the matter
up and also that she would not have to take
it up.</p>

<p>Suddenly on the twilight calm of the library
there arose a broken-hearted wail! Mildred had
broken out into an abandon of grief. Her wails
rent the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee whilikins! I thought the Germans had
come,&rdquo; exclaimed Kent, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling, what is it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Brown
as Mildred clutched her around the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Granny, Granny! My muvver hates
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly! What have you done to this
angel?&rdquo; asked the grandmother almost sternly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing! I declare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; it! She ain&rsquo;t done nuffin! That
shows she hates me. Kizzie done say, &lsquo;Who de
Lord loveneth he chases,&rsquo; an&rsquo; I done did the wussest
thing I could do an&rsquo; my muvver she ain&rsquo;t so
much as said: &lsquo;Why, Mildred!&rsquo; I wants to git
spanked! I wants to git spanked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, darling, what have you done?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Brown, trying to control her risibles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I done shave-pated, number-eighted my little
Haythen friend. Kizzie called Cho-Cho:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&ldquo;&lsquo;Shave pate, number eight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hit yo&rsquo; haid aginst the gate.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;It sho did hurt Cho-Cho&rsquo;s feelings. And Cho-Cho,
she slish-slashed my hair off so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d look
cute. Nobody ain&rsquo;t told us we look cute&mdash;and
nobody ain&rsquo;t spanked us nor nothin&rsquo;&mdash;and nobody
don&rsquo;t love us.&rdquo; This tirade came out between
sobs.</p>

<p>Kent and Judy roared with laughter but
Molly and her mother tried to look sad and
mournful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, I&rsquo;m astonished! Why don&rsquo;t you
spank your kid? I never heard of such an inhuman
parent,&rdquo; teased Kent.</p>

<p>Molly was very happy indeed. The miracle
had come! Her prayer was answered. She did
not have to punish Mildred. Mildred was punished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have treated yo&rsquo; dear little
children so mean, would you, Granny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet she wouldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; insisted Kent.
&ldquo;Why, if I had shave-pated, number-eighted
my little Haythen friends, your granny would
have torn me limb from limb and beaten me black
and blue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho nuf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, and if my little Haythen friend
had chopped off all my pretty curls, I am sure
her mother would have thrown her in the fire and
poked holes in her with a red hot poker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; &rsquo;cause they loved you so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, just because they loved us so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me&rsquo;n&rsquo; Cho-Cho wisht we could git throwed in
the fire,&rdquo; sighed the repentant Mildred. &ldquo;But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Uncle Kent,&rdquo; and she got up and put her little
mouth close to his ear, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think I made
a mighty cunning little Japanese dolly out&rsquo;n my
Haythen friend?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A DEATH</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Aunt Judy, my Poilu is tellible sick! He
can&rsquo;t open up his mouf mo&rsquo;n &rsquo;bout a minute far.
Won&rsquo;t you please, ma&rsquo;m, punch it open wif the
button hook so&rsquo;s I kin poke some breafkast down
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mildred had the little puppy clasped in her
arms and he did seem to be very miserable. His
eyes were partly closed and his teeth were tightly
clamped together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I weckon that big ol&rsquo; dog what eated a piece
out&rsquo;n him done made him so sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, honey, that was a week ago, and if it
had been going to make him sick it would surely
have affected him long ago. It was nothing but
a scratch, and don&rsquo;t you remember Aunt Judy
bound it up so tight it only bled a moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy and Kent had remained at Wellington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
for a visit. Kent was so soon to join his regiment
that he felt he could not tear himself away from
his mother and sister, so they had lingered on
after the other guests had departed. The bride
and groom had also returned after a flying visit
to Nance&rsquo;s old home and were now with the McLeans,
Nance declaring that Andy&rsquo;s mother
must have all she could of her son before he was
to sail for France.</p>

<p>Judy took the puppy in her lap and smoothed
his silky sides. The little fellow opened his eyes
and gave her a grateful glance. Mildred did
squeeze a little too tight when a fellow felt as sick
as poor little Poilu did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe we had better get the doctor for him,&rdquo;
suggested Judy. &ldquo;There come Andy and Aunt
Nance now, across the campus! Call them, Mildred!
Andy is not too proud to doctor a dog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mildred delightedly ran to the door and waved
her arms frantically. &ldquo;Hi there, brideangroom!
brideangroom! Somebody&rsquo;s mighty sick in this
here house. Better hurry up or they might go
deaded!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Andy and Nance quickened their pace and
hastened into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; they cried anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my littlest brudder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dodo! What is the matter with my little
husband?&rdquo; asked Nance anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t Dodo! He ain&rsquo;t my littlest brudder.
I&rsquo;se got anudder brudder. Ain&rsquo;t you knowed
about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nance and Andy were much mystified, but
they followed the amusing little creature into the
library. Nance thought perhaps the big-hearted
Molly had adopted a French orphan,&mdash;Molly
was quite capable of doing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my brudder!&rdquo; and Mildred pointed
to the suffering puppy. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it too bad he&rsquo;s
got a tail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy laughed as he lifted the poor little Poilu
to his own knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him, Andy?&rdquo; was
Judy&rsquo;s anxious query.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like the last stages of tetanus.&rdquo; The
patient was even then in a violent convulsion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Andy mercifully laid his handkerchief over the
little fellow&rsquo;s head, dreading that Mildred should
see his suffering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d put him out of his misery but he will be
gone in a moment anyhow,&rdquo; he said sadly. &ldquo;Has
he been hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A week ago he got bitten by a dog, but it
was a mere scratch and did not amount to a row
of pins, so Molly and I decided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you put anything on the wound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a surgical dressing down at the
war relief rooms. I remember it was one of the
beautifully made dressings Madame Misel had
just brought in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy sprang up, a wild light in his eye. The
puppy had breathed its last so he handed it over
to Judy without more ado.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Molly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has gone down in the village to pack
supplies at the war relief rooms. There were lots
of things to get off, so she went quite early. I
am to follow a little later, just as soon as Kent
finishes primping. What is the matter?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be much the matter. You and
Kent come as fast as you can,&rdquo; and Andy and
Nance hurried off without any more explanation.</p>

<p>The news was broken to Mildred that her pet
was no more and her bruised heart was much
comforted with promises of a funeral later on
when Kizzie got time to make arrangements.
Kent and Judy caught up with Andy and Nance
before they reached the old church where the war
work was carried on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What under Heaven is the matter?&rdquo; panted
Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be nothing, but I must investigate.
Let&rsquo;s go in as quietly as possible. Does Madame
Misel still work on the surgical dressings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! And such beautiful work as
she does! Molly insists that she must have a
great deal of good in her to give so much time to
this work. Sometimes I think I must have
dreamed that they spoke as they did that night
in the garden. Why should pro-Germans and
spies choose this particular spot, anyhow?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The workroom was filled with very busy ladies
when our young couples entered. Molly was tying
up dressings, after carefully inspecting and
counting them. An order had come for many
bandages and other dressings and all hands were
at work trying to get them off. Madame Misel
was deftly arranging the rolled bandages in
pyramids and then tying them with strings made
of the selvedge torn from the cotton. Nothing
goes to waste in this war work. Madame&rsquo;s
countenance was as calm as ever as she bent over
her work, but when she saw the two men enter,
Judy noticed a sudden alertness in her glance
and a tiny spot of red on her usually white cheek.
As she pulled the selvedge string, she must have
given it an unusual tug for it broke and the
tightly-rolled bandages flew hither and yon over
the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! There is no telling how many
germs got picked up in that scatteration,&rdquo; muttered
Andy as he stooped and gathered the bandages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;bandage&mdash;does&mdash;not&mdash;touch the&mdash;wound,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
said Madame, evidently forgetting
she was speaking to a surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Andy shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must speak with you a
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Andy dear, I am awfully busy. You
come home to luncheon with me, you and Nance,
and then you can speak all you&rsquo;ve a mind
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must speak now,&rdquo; whispered Andy
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens! Is anything the matter?&rdquo; asked
Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; and Andy drew her towards
the vestry at the back of the church. &ldquo;Tell me,
Molly, have you packed all the dressings that
that Misel woman has made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, not all of them! Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you mixed them with the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! They are so beautifully folded that I
do not have to inspect them, and so I have put
them in boxes to themselves. She is the best
worker I ever saw.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, I shall have to ask you not to get this
shipment off to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Andy, it is most important! The poor
wounded are bleeding to death and the ship sails
in two days. We must get them off this evening
if they are to catch that boat. What is your reason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Andy told her of the puppy&rsquo;s death.
He said the fact that his first aid had come from
those very rooms, and that tetanus, or lock-jaw,
had set in on a perfectly healthy puppy when he
had a mere scratch from another dog, made him
suspicious that tetanus germs were on some of
the bandages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Andy, that is ridiculous! Poor Madame
Misel may be in sympathy with Germany
in spite of all she says, she and her husband, but
she could not do such a vile thing as that.&rdquo;
Molly could not help feeling impatient and indignant
with her old friend. &ldquo;Only look at her
sweet face and all thought of such infamy will
leave your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Andy did glance towards Madame Misel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the look of venomous hatred that he surprised
on her face was shocking. The young physician
laughed grimly. &ldquo;Molly, you are no judge of
persons unless they happen to be angels. You
think wings are getting ready to sprout even
from our enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are! Who knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be right, but in the meantime,
please don&rsquo;t let any of these dressings get off. I
must see those Secret Service men. Where are
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin knows, I believe, but he has not told
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly was irritated beyond endurance. How
was she to let these women know that the shipment
must be held up? It was all of it so absurd.
The women had done the work and now these
men must come poking their fingers into the pie
that they had had none of the work of making.
The idea of accusing Madame Misel of such a
crime! Judy, too, seemed to be doubting the
stranger, and Nance, of course, would be aiding
and abetting Andy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to ask you to be very quiet, not
to give this creature an inkling of our suspicions,&rdquo;
commanded Andy sternly. &ldquo;That is
very important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, naturally, I&rsquo;ll hardly be so rude as to
let her think anyone is so unkind as to doubt
her,&rdquo; and Molly&rsquo;s lip trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, dear Molly, don&rsquo;t hate me so. I can&rsquo;t
help seeing that something is wrong and if I have
the slightest suspicion, I must surely probe to the
bottom. You must see that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, Andy, but I just can&rsquo;t bear
to have anybody abused, especially a woman who
makes such lovely dressings,&rdquo; and Molly tried to
smile at her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll depend upon you to stop the work
of getting them off and still not let the woman
know she is under suspicion. Just go on packing
but do not make the shipment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate to resort to such subterfuge, but I&rsquo;ll
do my best,&rdquo; sighed Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to bring one criminal
to justice than to kill thousands of poor wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
men by dressing their wounds with tetanus
germs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, only&mdash;but&mdash;you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see that your heart is so tender and
you are so honest yourself you think all the world
must be like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly went sadly back to her packing, all the
joy and zest gone out of her work. How could
nice men like Andy and Kent think such things
about a poor defenseless woman? No doubt she
did have a sneaking sympathy for Germany.
Was not that natural? Had she and her countrymen
not been under German rule long enough
to consider the kaiser as their rightful ruler? Because
her husband chose to pretend to be lame
was no reason why everybody should think Madame
Misel capable of such a dastardly thing as
putting tetanus germs on the bandages of poor
wounded soldiers. That was something no
woman, no matter how bad, could do,&mdash;and
surely this woman was not bad, not really bad.
Molly Brown was so constituted that one had to
be proven to be bad before she could believe evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of him or her, and then, as a rule, she would find
some excuse for the sinner if not for the sin.</p>

<p>Nance and Judy stayed on to help in the work,
while Andy and Kent went to find the Secret
Service agents. While the task of making bandages,
etc., went rapidly forward, the detectives
quietly ransacked the cottage occupied by the
Misels. This was the first opportunity they had
had of going over the house. The occupants had
never before left it alone. Much of dire importance
was discovered. Among other things a
small laboratory where no doubt all kinds of evil
germs were incubated. The search was made
very rapidly, as they were anxious to leave things
in such order that the owners would not suspect
that they were under surveillance.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>GERMS</small></h2>


<p>As the two quietly-dressed, intelligent looking
men were in the act of going through a desk, they
saw from the window the slow and painful approach
of M. Misel. Without a word they let
themselves out of a back window, left open for
emergencies, and before the master had opened
the front door the detectives were over the back
fence and out of sight. They were desirous of
catching more than the Misels in their net and
did not want to act too quickly.</p>

<p>Had they peeped through the window, they
would have seen Misel with an impatient gesture
sling his crutch in one direction, his cane in another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lena!&rdquo; he called, in anything but a gentle
tone. &ldquo;Lena!&rdquo; And then with muttered
curses, when he found his wife to be absent, he
settled himself to look over the bunch of mail he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had just obtained at the post-office. One letter
he examined very critically before opening. It
was an inoffensive enough looking envelope, addressed
on a typewriter and with a postmark from
New York. It had the appearance of a circular
or advertisement of some sort, being made of
cheap, greyish-white paper, the kind of letter one
would wait until last to open in a pile of mail, being
sure it was of no especial interest or importance.
Misel seemed to find it very interesting,
however. It was the one he chose from all the
letters and papers, and as he examined it, he
scowled darkly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lena!&rdquo; he called as Madame Misel hurriedly
entered the cottage, &ldquo;Lena, some fool has
been meddling with my mail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not such a big fool as you are!&rdquo; she
answered tartly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! The envelope has been opened before.
Of course it is the letter from Fritz von
Lestes, the one we have been awaiting.&rdquo; He tore
it open and read aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;The paint which you
have ordered will be delivered immediately. Am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
sorry there should have been any delay. I am
sending a light grey, as agreed upon.&rsquo; Umm&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t see how they could make much out of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see the letter.&mdash;Of course they can
make much out of it as there is no address,&mdash;you
men bungle things so! Why should a man who
is in the paint business write a letter with no address
and sign his name so illegibly that no one
could make it out? He should have had a letter
head and a business envelope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And speaking of bungling,&mdash;why did you go
and leave the house with no one in it? Can&rsquo;t you
see that is imprudent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Green came for me and I had no excuse.&mdash;Besides,
I am sure if I am by when the
dressings are handed in that no one will inspect
my work. I have been packing all morning and
have seen to it that my labor has not been in
vain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, peerless woman!&rdquo; he said sarcastically.</p>

<p>Madame Misel said nothing but busied herself
over the luncheon. Suddenly she gave a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
cry, half distress, half indignation. Misel hastened
to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look! This back window is not quite closed!
Did you open it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I have not been here in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then someone has been in the house,&rdquo; she
announced in a dead tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! I left the windows locked, stupid!
Look about and see if all is in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The detectives had worked as neatly as detectives
can work, but the Misels found several
traces of them. In one room a chair had been
moved; in another a drawer had not been shut as
close as Madame was confident she had left it;
papers had been turned over in the desk, Misel
was sure, although none were missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone has been in the laboratory, too!
Look at this crucible! I always place them so,&mdash;and
this has been turned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair faced each other with despair on their
countenances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; they gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must make a flitting this very night!&rdquo;
exclaimed the woman. &ldquo;Thank goodness, nobody
dreams that you are not crippled nor that
I am anything but the homely hausfrau I appear.
The dressings will be off this very afternoon, too,
so my work is completed in that line, at least. If
you could boast as much, no doubt you would not
mind leaving. I told you to begin the teaching
at Exmoor sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The youths were not ripe for it. I have begun
in a way, but not much has been accomplished.
Perhaps the person who has been here
is just some prying neighbor and we are not
really being watched. Go out and see if you can
discover anything!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Madame Misel peeped through the windows
of the old church she saw enough to make
her turn pale. Andy McLean was there with
two strange men and Professor and Mrs. Green.
Molly was weeping bitter tears as she untied the
carefully packed surgical dressings. Madame
saw at a glance that it was her work that was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
examined by the men. She did not stop to
make sure what they found on her beautifully
made dressings, but turned and fled towards the
cottage that she called home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is she weeping?&rdquo; she asked herself, and
there was woman enough in her to know that
Molly wept because one of her own sex had
proved faithless.</p>

<p>Blinds were pulled down in the cottage with
the lovely old garden, and the activities that ensued
could only be equaled by a circus breaking
up to leave town. Madame Misel moved with a
quiet precision that showed she was an adept at
making a quick get-away. Misel worked with a
fury of impatience. He went through his desk,
scattering papers hither and yon and burning
everything of no value. Other documents he
stowed carefully away in his breast pocket. The
laboratory was dismantled and small, mysterious-looking
vials packed in boxes and placed in
the huge suit-case that seemed to hold most of
their belongings.</p>

<p>A letter was written to the landlord informing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
him that his tenants had been called out of Wellington
by the illness of a fictitious sister. A
month&rsquo;s rent was enclosed. Another letter was
written to the postmaster asking that mail be forwarded
to an entirely imaginary address. The
work proceeded rapidly. The cottage was always
in apple-pie order, as Madame Misel was
certainly an excellent housekeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must write to the president of the college,&rdquo;
commanded Madame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naturally! Must I use the same sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! Why two lies when one will suffice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A letter to Miss Walker was dispatched forthwith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now for our disguises,&mdash;or rather the
time has come to discard our disguises!&rdquo; cried
Madame almost joyfully. &ldquo;I hate to appear as
such a frump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Misel&rsquo;s disguise was composed principally of
cane and crutch, but at his wife&rsquo;s instigation he
shaved his mustache. With the help of a checked
suit and red necktie and a brown derby hat a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
trifle too small for him, the pathetic and interesting
teacher of the French language was transformed
into the type of man one sees hanging
around a race track. With a clever brush Madame
put a quirk in his eyebrows that completed
the portrait. Then a bit of court plaster was
stuck on one of the perfect teeth which gave the
handsome Misel a sinister look and suggested to
the beholder former battles and fisticuffs in which
he had been struck in the mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even your dying sister will not recognize
you!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>Madame&rsquo;s transformation was even more
startling than her husband&rsquo;s. First she shook out
her smoothly brushed hair and with the help of
curling tongs soon had a wave that the finest hair
dresser in New York could not have exceeded.
She piled her abundant hair up in curls and
twists and coils, pulling out puffs over her ears.
Then with pencil and rouge pot and powder puff
she went to work on her countenance. A raging
beauty was the outcome, but rather fast and loud
looking. A lavender suit lined and slashed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
corn-colored silk was then donned, with many
rings and bracelets. The flat-heeled shoes were
packed away in the suit-case with the sober costume,
and high-heeled French boots were fitted
on in their stead. A plentiful sprinkling of musk
was added so that the nostrils were assailed as
soon as the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tough sports!&rdquo; would have been the verdict
of anyone meeting the Misels. They had decided
on the night train to New York. The cottage
was carefully locked, the key enclosed in the letter
to the landlord, which they posted on their
way to the station. Everything was going
smoothly. The station was empty when the pair
stepped upon the platform and in a moment the
New York train came steaming around the
curve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God, we are getting away unnoticed!&rdquo;
gasped Misel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God if you choose, but it would be
more to the point if you thanked me. I can&rsquo;t see
that anyone has helped you but me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well! Have it your own way!&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the spurious bookmaker as they boarded the
train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone got left,&rdquo; he laughed as they took
their seats in the chair car. &ldquo;I saw a man and
woman running down the road just as we got
aboard. I am glad they got left. Whoever it is
might have recognized us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Didn&rsquo;t I tell you your own dying
sister would not know you?&rdquo; and Madame
Misel smoothed her lavender draperies and
jangled her many bracelets and rings, peeping in
the mirror meantime to adjust her large beplumed
hat. There was a commotion in the end
of the Pullman and she heard a familiar voice.
In the mirror she espied a familiar face, and under
the heavily laid on rouge, the woman paled
and the hand that adjusted her hat shook. Misel
buried his face in the evening paper some traveler
had left in his seat, while the innocent cause of
their perturbation found a seat with the help of
the porter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>HER FATHER&rsquo;S OWN DAUGHTER</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you take it so hard, Molly
darling,&rdquo; said Judy as Molly told her of the detectives&rsquo;
findings and of the perfidy they had unearthed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I fancy I am grieving that such wickedness
can be in this world,&rdquo; sighed Molly. &ldquo;I
liked Madame Misel so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never did like her,&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>

<p>Molly smiled, well remembering Judy&rsquo;s enthusiasm
on arriving at Wellington and telling
of the interesting couple she had met on the train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you are thinking about&mdash;of
course I said they were interesting, but I never
did like the woman much&mdash;she was too catty for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This conversation was interrupted by the loud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
ringing of the telephone bell, which proved to be
a long distance call for Judy from Mr. Kean in
New York. His marching orders had come and
he was to sail for France in a few days, and for
the first time on record he could not take his little
wife with him. Building roads and bridges in
war time was very different from times of peace,
and France at that time was no place for delicate
little ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better come right up to New York
on the next train,&rdquo; was his ringing command.
&ldquo;Your mother needs you and I must see you,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Bobby! Meet me at the Pennsylvania
Station. I&rsquo;ll take the 12.45&mdash;I am not going
to let Kent come. He must be with his
mother one more day,&mdash;his mother and Molly.
So long! Be sure and meet me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then such a scrambling ensued! Kent must
be persuaded he was neither wanted nor needed,
a few things hurled into a bag, her sketch book
tucked in her jacket pocket, and Judy was off
like a whirlwind. She and Kent ran all the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to the station only to see the train pulling out as
they stepped upon the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can get it! Keep the old bag!&rdquo; cried that
young woman as she sprinted down the track,
her young husband running lightly by her side,
laughing in spite of himself. If you have never
run after a train and caught it you cannot realize
the triumphant feeling Judy had as she grasped
the rail and swung herself up on the rear coach.
Fortunately it was not a vestibule train or she
would have been shut out. Kent slung the bag
up after her and then stood in the middle of the
track until his Judy was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a girl she is!&rdquo; he laughed to himself.
&ldquo;What a dear girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dear girl was rescued by a rather indignant
brakeman and led through the empty coach
that happened to be hitched on to the train and
finally installed in the chair car, after many explanations
and excuses had been made to train
conductor and then Pullman conductor.</p>

<p>Young women have no business on night trains
with no tickets&mdash;certainly no business in boarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
those trains from the rear, thereby risking
their own necks and making the railroads liable
to damage suits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see my father telephoned me from
New York,&rdquo; she confided to the train conductor,
a grizzled looking old fellow with a decidedly
military bearing. &ldquo;He is going to France next
week and he simply had to see me.&mdash;Perhaps you
know my father,&rdquo; she added with a certain assurance
that everybody connected with railroads
ought to know Bobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than likely!&rdquo; was the grim reply. The
conductor had no idea of being cajoled into good
humor by this daring girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Mr. Robert Kean,&mdash;Bobby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conductor was suddenly a changed creature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know him! I should say I did! Bless my
soul, if you don&rsquo;t look like him&mdash;same eyes&mdash;same
mouth! Ha, ha! See Bob Kean missing a
train! Not much!&rdquo; and the erstwhile stern captain
of the train now grasped Judy&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll see that you get a chair, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Kean. I&rsquo;m certainly pleased to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Miss Kean any more,&mdash;I&rsquo;m Mrs.
Kent Brown now.&mdash;It was my husband who
pitched me and my luggage on the back end of
the train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married! By jiminy! I can&rsquo;t believe Bob
Kean has a married daughter! And your husband
aided and abetted you in jumping on the
back of fast trains, did he?&rdquo; and the once grim
captain laughed aloud. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you
got a game husband. I don&rsquo;t know what your
father would have done with a &rsquo;fraid cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy&rsquo;s entrance in the Pullman caused some
commotion. The old conductor was laughing
heartily and the brakeman was in a much pleasanter
frame of mind as he handed over Judy&rsquo;s
bag to the grinning porter. There were about
eight persons in the chair car as Judy entered
and Judy-like, she immediately became intensely
interested in them.</p>

<p>Of course, the spot of color made by a flashy
dame in lavender attracted her attention first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and then her companion in loud checks cried out
to be noticed. What a couple! Race track written
all over both of them! Even from three seats
off Judy could smell the musk on the woman.
The man&rsquo;s face was hidden by the newspaper and
the woman seemed to be engaged in rapt contemplation
of her beauty in the narrow little mirror
by her chair. To Judy&rsquo;s disappointment the
gaudy dame whirled her chair around so she
could not see her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet she&rsquo;s a peacherino!&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>

<p>There were other persons in the train that
proved interesting, too: among them a mother
and child who appealed to Judy&rsquo;s artistic sense;
a G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. veteran who was sure he had been in
worse battles than the Marne; an ancient lady
from Louisiana who made our young artist wild
to paint her white hair and patrician nose. Opposite
Judy&rsquo;s chair was a young man, (or was he
a young man?) At least he was not an old man!
There were a few tiny lines around his twinkling
bright blue eyes, but his movements were as alert
as a college athlete&rsquo;s, and his mouth, though very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
firm, had the saucy expression of a street boy.
Judy was sure she had seen his face before. The
way his hair grew on his forehead in a so-called
widow&rsquo;s peak reminded her vaguely of someone,&mdash;the
cleft chin she was sure she had known
somewhere. He was interested in her, too, she
could plainly see. He had a pleasant, dependable
expression, the kind of look one felt meant
that in time of trouble he would be a good person
to call on. He was making himself generally
useful to the madonna-like mother and child; he
had assisted the ancient lady from Louisiana to
get up and sit down several times since Judy had
so unceremoniously boarded the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew where I had known him. His
face is as familiar to me as my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She felt in her jacket pocket for her sketch
book. She must get an impression of the mother
and child, and the old lady was destined to be
sketched in, too. She longed to do the youngish-oldish
person opposite, but he was too close for
her to permit herself such a familiarity. She
turned over the leaves of her book and suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
came upon the page given up to the Tucker twins
and their friend Page Allison. What delightful
girls they were! Suddenly she could place the
resemblance seen in the gentleman across the
aisle. Of course his forehead and widow&rsquo;s peak
were the same that Dum Tucker owned, and his
cleft chin was the identical one belonging to Dee
Tucker. Could he be their father?</p>

<p>She remembered what the girls had told her of
their delightful father. He was a newspaper
man in Richmond, Virginia, and according to the
twins was just about the most wonderful person
in the world. Page Allison, too, had given him
praise, although not quite so wildly unstinted as
his daughters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll drop something and let him pick
it up for me and get in a conversation with him,&rdquo;
Judy laughed to herself. &ldquo;He is such a squire
of dames, he is sure to pick it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned the pages of her sketch book until
she came to the quick impressions she had made
of Madame Misel at the war relief rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wretch!&rdquo; was her inward comment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
her thoughts went back to the last days at Wellington.
She looked up; her eye was again
chained by the gaudy lavender spot and she suddenly
became conscious that she could see the
woman&rsquo;s face in the large mirror at the end of the
Pullman. Her eyes were down as she perused
the pages of a magazine.</p>

<p>Another familiar face! Where under Heaven
had she seen just that chin and nose? Her eyes
fell again on the open sketch book. Why, it is
Madame Misel&mdash;no other! With quick strokes
she copied the sketch and then cleverly added the
beplumed hat, fluffy collar and fashionably cut
coat. The woman stood up for a moment to get
something from the pocket of her great coat,
hanging on the hook at one side, and then Judy
took in her general contours standing, and added
some draperies to the full length figure she had
also obtained of Madame Misel in the work
room. High heels were put on the flat, unstylish
shoes. The straight severe dress and basque were
transformed into the fashionable, if gaudy, creation.
Judy was careful not to erase any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
original lines and all of the new parts she
sketched in in dots and dashes.</p>

<p>The gentleman opposite was plainly interested
in what she was doing and it evidently required
all his self-control to keep from asking to be allowed
to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the Misels and they are running
away!&rdquo; flashed into Judy&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;It is up to
me to stop them&mdash;but how? The gent in checks
is undoubtedly Misel. They can&rsquo;t fool me; I remember
his ears too well and the way his hands
held things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced across the aisle and her eyes met
the bright blue ones belonging to the widow&rsquo;s
peak and cleft chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would Bobby do in this case?&rdquo; she
asked herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use the sense God gave him and get help if
he couldn&rsquo;t cope with a thing single-handed,&rdquo; she
answered herself.</p>

<p>She accordingly let her sketch book slide from
her lap, rubber and pencil hopping gaily after it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you so much!&rdquo; she exclaimed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the squire of dames immediately dived for the belongings
and restored them to her. &ldquo;I would
not loose my sketch book for worlds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not! I have a daughter who is
very much interested in art,&mdash;in fact, she is
studying in New York now,&mdash;her specialty is
sculpture, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know her! She is Dum Tucker!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know my Dum! How wonderful!
And how did you know she was&mdash;I was her father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your widow&rsquo;s peak! I also know you are
Dee&rsquo;s father by your chin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker changed his seat, taking the one
by Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove! You artists are a clever lot. You
would make a great detective, Mrs. Brown. You
must excuse me for knowing your name, but I
heard you tell the captain what it was,&mdash;Mrs.
Kent Brown. My girls have written me how
kind you have been to them and I have been dying
to make myself known to you, but was waiting
for some kind of opening wedge.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, too, Mr. Tucker, have been wondering
where I had seen you, when I found your
girls&rsquo; pictures in my little book. See! Here they
are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And little Page, too!&rdquo; He exclaimed eagerly
scanning the sketches. &ldquo;You are wonderfully
clever at a likeness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? I&mdash;Mr. Tucker&mdash;I deliberately
scraped up an acquaintance with you because
I want you to do something for me,&rdquo; and
Judy looked frankly into the honest eyes of her
new acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Brown, you know I am at your
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sure of you somehow, even if I had
not been almost certain you were related in some
way to Dum and Dee Tucker. My little sketch
book told me that and it told me something else,
too, but I must begin at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Judy, whispering, began with her meeting of
the Misels, of her interesting the Greens at Wellington,
of Misel&rsquo;s substituting in French at the
college and of Madame&rsquo;s work in the war relief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Jeffrey Tucker&rsquo;s eyes flashed as the newspaper
man in him scented a rousing good story.
When Judy got to the part where she and her
friends went out in the night to hunt for adventure
and found it in the manly shape of Misel
taking strenuous exercise for a cripple, he
beamed with joy and felt in his pocket for a pencil.
Judy rapidly told him of the puppy&rsquo;s
wounded leg and of the tetanus germs as well as
ground glass being found in the dressings. He
set his square jaw and looked as though he could
eat the kaiser and all his crew at one mouthful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I have come to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement!&rdquo;</i>
gasped Judy, excitement making her breathless.
&ldquo;If I could recognize you by your likeness to my
sketches, I fancy I could also recognize Madame
Misel by sketches of herself. I got two of her
this morning at the war relief. The detectives
did not arrest them, as they want to get others
in their dragnet, but in some way the spies must
have caught on to the fact that they were under
suspicion, as they sneaked away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure as shooting! In fact they are on this
train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Tucker, you must compose yourself
if we mean to catch the creatures!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; and the eager man sank back in
his seat and tried to look as though he were having
a mild conversation with the attractive young
woman who had jumped on the back of the moving
train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that is better! Keep that nonchalant
expression for what I am going to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, fire away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are on this coach, just three seats
down.&mdash;Good boy, not to jump out of your skin!
Now I am going to show you my sketch of the
woman before and after. See, there is no doubt
about her! You walk to the smoker and on the
way back get a good look at her face and I bet
you will be convinced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jeffrey Tucker did as he was bid, giving Madame
Misel such a casual look that he aroused
no suspicion in her mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! This is great! I&rsquo;d rather bag some of
these spies than do big hunting in the African
Jungle. Now, most wise of all female detectives,
what do you advise? We must act
quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you should take the conductors, both
train and Pullman, into your confidence, and
then send telegrams to New York to have the
spies met with the proper reception. You can
telegraph Bobby, I mean my father, if you think
it best, and he can get in cahoots with the Secret
Service people in New York. Bobby is the kind
of man who doesn&rsquo;t let things go wrong. When
he bores a hole in the mountain it comes out on
the opposite side just exactly where he meant it
to,&mdash;when he swings a bridge across a river it
stays swung,&mdash;there is no giving way of supports
and undermining from washings,&mdash;Bobby
knows. If you telegraph him, he&rsquo;ll have detectives
there all right and they will have the necessary
warrants and handcuffs, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, Bobby it is!&rdquo; and Jeffrey Tucker
quickly took Mr. Kean&rsquo;s address. Next the conductors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
were interviewed, and those good Americans
quickly complied with any and every request.
A long and explicit telegram was written
to the gentleman who did not let mistakes happen,
another one sent to the chief of police, in
case Mr. Kean should not be at home to receive
the telegram, (Jeffrey Tucker being the kind of
man who did not let mistakes occur, either,) and
then there was nothing to do but sit quietly in the
Pullman and wait for the train to steam into
New York.</p>

<p>It seemed to Judy to be hours and hours, although
the time certainly passed pleasantly with
the friends she made on the train. She and Mr.
Tucker talked to everybody except the two
sporty looking individuals, and they would have
had the audacity to talk with them if they had
been given the slightest encouragement. But the
Misels kept their backs studiously turned to their
fellow travelers and did not court sociability.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE ARREST</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Suppose they get off at Manhattan Junction
and go to the Hudson Terminal instead of the
big Pennsylvania Station!&rdquo; panted Judy, her
eyes shining with excitement and her fluffy hair
standing on end as though an electric shock had
gone through her system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is giving the game away now?&rdquo; teased
her new friend. &ldquo;I thought of that and warned
the chief when I telegraphed him. If they do
get off there, I&rsquo;ll get off, too, and you can go on
to the other station where your father will meet
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much I will! I&rsquo;m going to keep my eye
on that lavender spot until I see those wrists with
something on them besides gold bracelets. You
see, I feel responsible for this pair, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the one to introduce them to Wellington society.
If they get off at Manhattan Junction, so do I.
Bobby will understand! He would have no use
for me if I didn&rsquo;t see it through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you are a real patriot, Mrs. Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am! But one thing sure I am
not going to give my husband to the cause, and
my father, and then let these mean spies go Scot-free.
Now my dear friend and sister-in-law
Molly,&mdash;Mrs. Edwin Green,&mdash;is so good that she
can&rsquo;t believe anyone can be bad. She is just as
patriotic as I am but she can&rsquo;t believe in the perfidy
of Germany and the Germans. I truly believe
she would not have the heart to nab these
wretches even if she could not deny their guilt.
Molly is an angel herself and I fancy maybe her
angelic qualities do rub off some even on the
worst characters. She may have helped this Madame
Misel some, who knows? But I am going
to help her even more by letting her get a taste
of real punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am going to do my best to help you
help her,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Tucker. &ldquo;We are nearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Manhattan Junction now and I do not see
our friends making ready to get off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair sat quietly while the train stopped for
a moment for passengers to change for the downtown
station. Judy and Mr. Tucker were on the
alert to leave the train if they saw the slightest
movement on the part of the Misels, but the latter
sat in evident certainty of their disguise not
having been penetrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the curtain is to go up in a moment!&rdquo;
cried Judy. &ldquo;I have never been in such a stew
of expectation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The train had entered its under-water tunnel
and in what seemed hardly a minute they found
themselves in the Pennsylvania Station. Jeffrey
Tucker, true to his nature, must assist the old
lady from Louisiana and the mother and child,
but this time he assisted them by calling the porter
and, with a generous tip, put them in his
hands. He had other and more urgent fish to
fry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bobby!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;They have
let him through the gates!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>So they had, and others, also. Mr. Robert
Kean was eagerly scanning the windows of the
coaches as they slowly passed in review. By his
side were several alert looking men in plain
clothes and near them were some brass-buttoned
policemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go out first,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Tucker to
the impatient Judy, who looked like a hunting
dog straining at the leash. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring up the
rear in case of a bolt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Misels got up quickly and without any
delay moved towards the door. They seemed
perfectly unconcerned, the woman patting her
curls and hat into shape and Misel actually having
the hardihood to cast an ogling glance at
Judy. That young woman returned his admiring
look with a saucy toss of her head, entering
into the game with her usual vim.</p>

<p>One hug for Bobby and a whisper in his
ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The handsome dame in lavender and the lout
in checks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He in turn handed the information on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
plain clothes men, who were ready with their
bracelets not made of gold.</p>

<p>The arrest was made so quietly that the
mother and child who were in the midst of it
never did know what was going on, and the old
lady from Louisiana took her serene way right
by the handcuffed Madame Misel without knowing
that that lady had had an addition made to
her bangles. Misel was inclined to give some little
trouble. When he realized they were trapped,
he started back into the chair car, but was met
in a head on collision by Jeffrey Tucker, who had
a few football tricks left over from his not so far
distant youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way! You fool!&rdquo; cried the
enraged Misel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Softly, my friend! The exit is the other
way,&rdquo; purred the redoubtable Mr. Tucker, at the
same time putting up his guard, seeing the foreigner
was about to spring upon him. &ldquo;Madame
has gone out by the door behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bang! Misel&rsquo;s fist shot out, but Jeffrey
Tucker was a match for any ordinary boxer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
having practiced that manly art to keep up with
his daughters who always put on the gloves to
settle any difficulty, and, as they expressed it, to
let off steam when the family atmosphere got too
thick. He dodged the blow, holding his guard
ready for the next.</p>

<p>Before the furious creature could recover himself
after having given the empty air such a drubbing,
the detectives approached him from the
rear and in a twinkling he was overcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he asked, attempting
an air of dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have to come and find out!&rdquo; was
the laconic reply deigned him by the grim policeman
who had him in charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Kean, I am sorry to tell you, but your
daughter will have to come to the police court to
tell what she knows of these persons,&rdquo; said the
leader of the plain clothes men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry! I want to see it through!&rdquo;
cried Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, we are to thank you for this indignity,&rdquo;
hissed Madame.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank me or the picturesque garden by your
cottage&mdash;whichever you choose. It is a stirring
thing to creep in that lovely garden on a romantic
night and suddenly to see a poor lame man who
has won the sympathy of the community, come
springing out in running togs and have him beat
Douglas Fairbanks and George Walsh in his
jumping. Then to have the gentle, courteous
Madame Misel boldly state that Wellington is
composed of blockheads,&mdash;all in perfect German,
too, which was a strange language for such good
Frenchmen to employ in the bosom of the
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judy, I wouldn&rsquo;t say any more!&rdquo; said her
father, but his eye was twinkling as he tucked his
daughter&rsquo;s hand under his arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker and Mr. Kean met as long lost
friends. They were what Judy called soul
brothers from the first. The old train conductor
stopped to exchange greetings with his one-time
acquaintance. He was loud in his praise of the
young lady who had scared them all to death by
jumping on the rear end of the moving train.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
He said nothing of the scolding he had given her
before he found out she was Bob Kean&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>The sketch book was convincing evidence that
the sporty couple were no other than Monsieur
and Madame Misel. Judy told her story well to
the chief, showing the clever sketches taken before
and after.</p>

<p>While they were at the police court, a long distance
message was received from Wellington
with the news that the flitting of the spies had
been discovered by the detectives sent there on
the case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been too late if you had not
been so wide awake,&rdquo; the chief informed Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I could have done nothing if Mr. Tucker
had not taken hold,&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear Mrs. Brown, you would have
found some other way, I am sure. You do not
come of a breed that lets accidents happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Misels turned out to be pure Prussian,
with not one drop of the blood of Alsace in their
veins. Their name was Mitzel and they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
many crimes to answer for. They had been on
the stage prior to the war and the man was a
noted acrobat and prestidigitator; the woman
had traveled with her husband and assisted him
in his work on the stage, being the hypnotized
lady, the Herodian mystery, the disappearing
spirit, the person who got tied up in the chest and
had a sword run through her,&mdash;anything, in fact,
that is usually required of the assistant in such a
business. They were employed to act as spies
and to disseminate all the German propaganda in
their power.</p>

<p>Misel, or Mitzel, was to have insinuated an
anti-draft spirit at Exmoor, the male college
near Wellington. Also to influence the girls at
Wellington, who in their turn were to influence
their brothers and sweethearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bobby! Only suppose we had not gone
out that night in search of adventure!&rdquo; cried
Judy, when she was safe under her mother&rsquo;s
wing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you just suppose you had never
been born?&rdquo; boomed the delighted Bobby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
&ldquo;When you were once born you were sure to be
out hunting adventure. You are made that way,
eh, Mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid she is,&rdquo; sighed that tiny
lady. &ldquo;You and Judy are exactly alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind?&rdquo; asked her big husband humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I would not have either one of you different.
But I fancy Kent and I are in for lives
of anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he likes us the way we are, too,&rdquo; declared
Judy, blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have two things to say:&rdquo; declared
Mr. Kean, giving a mighty yawn, &ldquo;I am glad I
let you have a Parisian education if with it you
can make clever enough sketches to catch these
German spies; and the other is, that it is high
time we were all of us in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Mitzel, before she was sentenced to
the imprisonment that she so richly deserved,
requested an interview with Judy, which
was granted, although Judy was most reluctant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to see her again! She looked
like a snake caught in a net.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;want&mdash;you&mdash;to tell&mdash;Mrs. Green&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;am
sorry for&mdash;her to&mdash;know&mdash;about me&mdash;That
is all! If&mdash;I could&mdash;have&mdash;had a woman&mdash;like
that&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;my friend&mdash;in my&mdash;youth&mdash;I
would have&mdash;been different.&rdquo; She spoke in
the faltering manner she had used at Wellington,
one she employed in speaking English, and then
she plunged into voluble German, so rapid that
Judy could hardly follow her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you! You have outwitted me and I
cannot but admire you for it, but I hate you with
all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all right! I&rsquo;d rather have your hate
than your love! I&rsquo;ll tell Molly, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we leave the Misels, or Mitzels, for
good, I must tell you that the shipment of paint
arrived at Wellington as the mysterious dealer
had informed Monsieur Jean Misel it would.
One of the Secret Service men remained in Wellington
to receive it. It was light grey, as was
promised; at least, it was marked light grey on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the outside of the six large cans. On opening
these cans, which I can assure you the detective
did with the utmost caution, many things besides
paint were disclosed,&mdash;in fact, there was no paint
there at all. He found various chemicals, necessary
for the making of the modern bomb; poisons
of all sorts, and innocent looking little vials containing
deadly germs. Those six cans if let loose
on the unsuspecting community would have
caused as much damage as the imps in Pandora&rsquo;s
box.</p>

<p>Even Molly had to confess that the Misels
were not very good persons, and when her husband
gave her to understand that her own little
Mildred and Dodo might have been poisoned by
polluted water had the foreigners accomplished
all they no doubt intended to with some of those
bottled germs, the young mother came to the conclusion
that they were not only not very good but
they were extremely wicked, and perhaps just
imprisonment was too mild a punishment to be
meted out to them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THEY ALSO SERVE</small></h2>


<p>There was a very serious meeting of students
of Wellington being held in the library of the
Square Deal. Twenty of the leading spirits of
the student body had asked Mrs. Edwin Green
to let them confer with her on a most important
matter.</p>

<p>The college authorities had announced that the
H.&nbsp;C. of L. had affected Wellington just as it
had every person and every institution, and students&rsquo;
board would have to be raised for the ensuing
year. This came as a blow to the majority
of girls. Going to college is an expensive matter
at best, and while there are many rich girls gathered
in those institutions, the majority come from
homes of moderate incomes and many from actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
poverty. It will never be known how many
sacrifices had been made to educate some of those
Wellington girls, and the H.&nbsp;C. of L. had affected
their families just as much as it had the
institution; and the news that the following year
college expenses would increase had caused much
consternation in the student body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t stand for it!&rdquo; said one tense little
girl from Indiana, who had been working her
way through three years of college by doing all
kinds of odd jobs, which reminded Molly of her
own strenuous student days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder on you than me, Mary Culbertson,&rdquo;
said a sturdy sophomore. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
but one more year. At least I haven&rsquo;t wasted as
much time in this old joint as you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, please don&rsquo;t look upon it as
wasted time,&rdquo; begged Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I came for a degree and if I don&rsquo;t get
it, I consider I have wasted two years. I might
just as well have taken a job at home. A teacher&rsquo;s
place was open for me then and now it may
be filled for good. A degree will give one a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
salary, but two years of college won&rsquo;t get you
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure some scheme can be worked to
keep down the expenses,&rdquo; insisted Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t live on less food!&rdquo; bluntly declared
Lilian Swift.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor plainer!&rdquo; from a discontented one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be plainer without being less nourishing,&rdquo;
suggested Molly. &ldquo;How about your
doing some light housekeeping on your own hook
and not trying to board with the college?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am sure the college authorities do not
make money on the girls as it is,&rdquo; said Billie McKym,
who had come to the meeting from truly
altruistic motives, as expenses made no difference
to her personally. &ldquo;If a great body of girls
cannot be fed on the amount charged now, I am
certain a girl could not live on less if she went in
for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billie, with all her wealth, had a good keen eye
for business and understood the management of
money rather better than any poor girl at Wellington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon you are right,&rdquo; said Molly sadly.
&ldquo;Would you girls mind if I ask my husband to
come in and talk it over with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; in chorus. &ldquo;Bring him in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that knowing how to read Chaucer in
old English will make him wise as how to live on
nothing a year,&rdquo; whispered one.</p>

<p>Professor Green was in the den with his cousin,
old Major Fern, who had motored in from the
country to have a chat with his favorite kinsman.
Molly entered, smiling at the clouds of tobacco
smoke which almost obscured the two gentlemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin, I know the Major will excuse you
for a moment. I need you badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear! But I hope it is nothing
serious that is beclouding your fair brow,&rdquo;
said the old gentleman with the courteous manner
of his generation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is serious in a way,&rdquo; and Molly told
her husband and his cousin what was the problem
the girls had brought to her to solve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I can&rsquo;t blame the college authorities,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
she sighed. &ldquo;It is hard to feed people as
it is, and with expenses going up, up, I know
they will have to raise the board. But on the
other hand, there are many girls who simply cannot
pay more than they are already paying. I
feel for them, as I was one of them when I was at
college. If the board had been raised one nickel
I should have had to stop. I almost had to as it
was. If it had not been for Edwin&rsquo;s fondness
for apples, I should have been degreeless to this
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adam and I!&rdquo; laughed the professor. &ldquo;But
what do you want me to do, Molly? I am yours
to command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly! I thought you might
talk to the girls and we might keep on thinking
and praying until some solution is reached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a proposition to make that might interest
your college friends,&rdquo; said Major Fern.
&ldquo;They may scorn it, but on the other hand they
may like the idea. Let me talk to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely! I knew there would be a
way,&rdquo; cried the optimistic Molly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you hear it first,&rdquo; smiled the old
gentleman.</p>

<p>Molly led the way to the library, where the
twenty girls were having a hot discussion on
ways and means. She introduced Major Fern,
who took his seat among them and beamed on
them with kindly eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I am not much of a
public speaker but I am going to put a plan before
you and see how it strikes you. I understand
that you are making a kick because of the
raising of board for the ensuing year&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know that everything is going
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything but prayer!&rdquo; from the discontented
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even that may be going up, too,&rdquo; he answered
solemnly. &ldquo;Now listen: Perhaps you
know that I am rich,&mdash;not so rich as some, but
richer than I have any right to be or any reason
for being&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Mary Culbertson tossed her proud little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
head as much as to let him know that charity was
not what she wanted. Major Fern saw her and
smiled his approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea of offering any of my ill-gotten
gold to you.&mdash;I know how you would hate that.
In fact, I haven&rsquo;t any gold to offer. I am rich
only in land and about as poor as they make &rsquo;em
in other things. I am really land poor, having
much more land than I have any use for or can
till. I can&rsquo;t get labor to keep up my farms. I
have been thinking of selling an especially fertile
farm about four miles from Wellington, but I
don&rsquo;t want to lose money on it, and if I sell at this
time I am sure to. This farm comprises about
two hundred acres of as good land as one can find
in these parts, and that is saying a great deal.
And now I am coming to my scheme&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gentleman paused while the girls
waited in breathless eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will let you have this farm if you will work
it for me,&mdash;have it for as long as you need it.
You don&rsquo;t know what can be done in the way of
intensive farming if one can get the labor. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
could raise enough potatoes to run your mess for
the winter; enough tomatoes and beans to can,
and what&rsquo;s more you can can them right on the
spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Billie McKym.
&ldquo;The problem is solved or I&rsquo;m a Boche.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to undertake it?&rdquo; asked the
Major.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we are willing!&rdquo; cried Lilian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ones who live far can take the first part
of the summer, and the last, just before college
opens, and the ones who are close can fill in during
the midsummer,&rdquo; said Molly, immediately
grasping the possibility of the plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll leave it to you young ladies to
work up, and when you care to, I&rsquo;ll take you over
the place. There is a good house and well and
plenty of fruit,&mdash;apples to feed to the hogs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That suits me!&rdquo; declared Edwin, who had
been quiet while his cousin was unfolding the
plan. &ldquo;I see no reason, seriously, why this idea
should not be wonderfully successful,&mdash;not only
should it bring you back to college and keep you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
for the same, or even less, money than you have
hitherto had to pay, but it will at the same time
help materially in the food situation that the
country is going to have to face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be one of that committee that must
take hold of this thing?&rdquo; asked Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the student body so wishes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we so wish!&rdquo; came from twenty
throats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and Mrs. Green,&mdash;she is already one of
us. As for you, Major Fern, we hardly know
how to thank you for what you have done,&rdquo; said
the president of the juniors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me! I have done nothing! Instead
of selling a farm at a loss when I can&rsquo;t get
labor to work it, I am going to ask some beautiful
young ladies to work it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might drink him down,&rdquo; whispered a
timid girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! Drink him down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And without more ado the twenty girls, with
Molly chiming in and Edwin holding down a
second, sang:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Major Fern! Drink him down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s to Major Fern! Drink him down!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s to Major Fern! Here&rsquo;s to Major Fern!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink him down! Drink him down! Drink him down!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! That beats a wreath of bay,&rdquo; beamed
the dear old gentleman. &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll take
myself off. I forgot to say I&rsquo;ll have the land
turned under for you and give the use of a team
whenever you need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was gone. The girls, who only a few moments
before had felt so depressed, were now
filled with hope and animation. Degrees were
to be had, after all. Of course it meant work,
but that would be fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, gee! I&rsquo;m happy!&rdquo; cried Mary Culbertson.
&ldquo;But we must get busy in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First we must see Prexy and get her to coöperate,&rdquo;
suggested Molly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Let&rsquo;s do it in order, and find out if
we do our part if the college authorities will do
theirs. I dote on digging potatoes, myself,&rdquo;
said Lilian.</p>

<p>Committees were formed immediately; one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
see Prexy; one to go view their estate; another to
look into housing conditions; another to canvas
the student body and find out who would and
who wouldn&rsquo;t, who preferred to plant and who to
reap.</p>

<p>Billie McKym was wild with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Do you realize, Molly, that I won&rsquo;t have to
spend a summer in Newport, after all? I can
put it up to my relations that I am needed in
these parts. I mean to ask for a larger allowance,
though, as I can help out some on the sly.
I am thinking about buying some Close-to-Nature
houses and presenting them to the agricultural
club. We shall have to have overalls, too,&mdash;and
farming implements.&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll make
Grandmother and Uncle come across in good
shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prexy, Miss Walker, was not only willing to
coöperate but delighted that the students were
finding a way out of the difficulty. It was a
deep grief to her, this raising of prices, and she
knew only too well how many girls would be cut
out of their degrees by this necessary step.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Many interviews with Major Fern had to be
arranged and many meetings of committees had
to be held, but finally everything was under way
for the agricultural club&rsquo;s work on the farm so
kindly donated by its delighted owner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I begin to feel that I&rsquo;m helping to
win the war!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have been hating
myself for a useless hulk of a veteran who was
too old to fight and too old-fashioned to suggest
to others how to fight, but if I can be the means
of keeping a lot of girls at college I think I am
doing pretty well; especially if by so doing, those
girls will grow food enough for themselves.
Every potato is equal to a hand grenade and
every bean to a bullet.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>THE TRENCHES</small></h2>


<p>Molly and Edwin found themselves deeper in
this agricultural scheme than they had at first
bargained for. If it was to be done at all, it
must be well done and quickly. There must be
order and system. Suddenly they awoke to the
realization that if it was to be well done and
quickly done, it was up to them, the Greens, to
do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, my dear, that you must be the
chaperone and I must turn farmer. This is a
stupendous undertaking and for the good name
of Wellington we must see it through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will mean work all summer for you, when
you so need a holiday, you poor old fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need no more holiday than you do. You
haven&rsquo;t been idle one minute this whole college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
year. I have a feeling that this summer we have
no business with holidays anyhow. The world is
too busy, too upset for any of us, who are able, to
lay off. I mean to dig and delve here at home
and do all the good I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to rent the Orchard Home
for the summer, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Molly, turning
her head away so her husband could not see
what it cost her to make that suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly honey, I can&rsquo;t bear to think of
it. It is hard enough on you not to be able to go
to Kentucky for vacation, but I don&rsquo;t think you
should have to think of strangers as being among
your apple trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be bad, not nearly so bad as you
think. At least, the little brown bungalow won&rsquo;t
be quite so lonesome as it would be empty all the
year, and we might buy tons of seed with the rent
money or even take care of some war orphans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you are right,&mdash;you usually are. I&rsquo;ll
write to a real estate agent in Louisville immediately
and put it on the market for the summer.
I hate to do it, though. Not that it will make so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
much difference to me. Wherever you are is my
Orchard Home, honey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Major&rsquo;s farm was dubbed &ldquo;The
Trenches&rdquo; by the members of the agricultural
club. It was a suitable name, for these girls felt
that they were in the war almost as much as the
soldier boys themselves.</p>

<p>Early in May Molly moved to the old farmhouse
to superintend arrangements for the many
girls later to be housed there. It was decided to
run the place more or less as a military camp is
run, with squads detailed for various duties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only our trench digging will be in the potato
fields and our drilling in the bean patch,&rdquo; Billie
declared.</p>

<p>Billie was in a state of ecstasy from the first.
She was General Molly&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, giving
time, money, and thought to the undertaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so splendid really to be helping! I
wanted to do something to help the Government
and now I believe I am going to. I should like
best to shoulder a gun and take a crack at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Huns, but since that cannot be, I&rsquo;ll shoulder a
pick and take a crack at the soil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Billie, whose post-graduate studies at Wellington
were not very important, had cut and
gone to The Trenches with Molly. They had
installed themselves in a corner of the rambling
old farmhouse and were as busy as bees getting
ready for the thirty girls who were to land on
them the last week in May. Katy and the two
children were with them, but Kizzie had been
left in Wellington to look after the master,
who was up to his neck in work for the finals at
college.</p>

<p>The students at Wellington had been canvassed
from A to Z, and with a deal of clerical
work, all of the ones who were to join the agricultural
club had been enrolled and their time of
service settled on and arranged for. Billie had
donated six Close-to-Nature houses which were
to be set up on the grassy lawn of the old farm.
The cots she had wheedled out or her uncle.
Farming implements, such as hoes, rakes, spades,
gasoline ploughs and cultivators she had, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
expressed it, &ldquo;blasted out of Grandmother McKym.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t understand me in the least, my
uncle and my grandmother, but they love me, I
really believe, and I fancy they always hope I&rsquo;ll
come to my senses and marry in &lsquo;the set&rsquo; some of
these days. They are really dears,&rdquo; Billie explained
to Molly as they helped to unload the
wagons that had just arrived laden with the tents
and implements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they are certainly very generous,&rdquo;
declared Molly, pulling out a bundle of rakes.</p>

<p>From the beginning these girls had determined
not to be dependent upon the merely masculine
to fetch and carry for them, and Molly and Billie
had pitched in with a will to do without men if
need be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, generous enough! They are glad
when I let them off with nothing more troublesome
than writing checks. I believe Uncle Donald
was scared stiff that I might insist on his coming
down here to help dig. And as for Grandmother,&mdash;she
would rather ante up thousands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
dollars than have to drag her silk skirts around in
the wet grass here at The Trenches. They don&rsquo;t
see for an instant that I am kind of patriotic in
helping this way. They think I am just a faddist.
Maybe I am, but somehow I feel that I have
ideals! Do you think I am just a silly goose to
think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed! I know you have ideals,&mdash;I
should hate to think you didn&rsquo;t,&mdash;very high
ideals,&rdquo; said Molly, as together they wheeled the
barrow laden with hoes and rakes out to the tool
house. &ldquo;I reckon your uncle and grandmother
have them, too, only perhaps they are not so open
about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they have them. Uncle Donald loves
to talk about them, but Grandmother isn&rsquo;t so
keen on expressing herself. Sometimes I think
his ideals are mostly literary and hers sartorial.
He is a great reader of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</i> and Grandmother
has an instinct for clothes that is truly remarkable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do like &rsquo;em, but I like to dress other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
persons better than I do myself. If I had been
poor, I&rsquo;d have gone into the business. I may do
it yet, but now until this war is over it seems to
me it doesn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference how anyone
is dressed&mdash;anybody but Mother Earth. The
soil dressed with a good fertilizer is more important
than silk raiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about literature?&rdquo; laughed Molly, her
friend&rsquo;s enthusiasm amusing her and at the same
time pleasing her. &ldquo;Do you think writing
should stop as well as dressing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course scribblers will scribble and
anyone who has a message to deliver will have to
spout it out, war time or not, but they may not
think they are so all-fired important. A letter
from the most ignorant soldier at the front will
have more real stuff in it than all of the vaporings
of the poet who only imagines gunfire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here far from the strife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we will make sonnets with hoe and
rake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our lines made by the gasoline plough shall
be beautiful and harmonious!&rdquo; suggested Molly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Our onion patch shall be worthy to be put
into verse along with Eugene Field&rsquo;s Onion
Tart,&rdquo; said Billie, going Molly one better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our potato field shall be as full of solid refreshment
as Charles Dudley Warner&rsquo;s five feet
of classics. Only smell the newly-ploughed
earth! Isn&rsquo;t it delicious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wagons were unloaded, the farming implements
piled neatly in the tool house and the
Close-to-Nature houses dotted about the lawn
ready for the stupendous task of being put up.
The girls were waiting for Katy, whom they had
dubbed &ldquo;the powerful Katrinka,&rdquo; to come help
them with that job. Katy was in her element.
She had been born and raised in the country, and
now that she was once more where things were
growing, where she could help them grow, she
was as happy an Irish girl as there was in all the
land. Nothing was too difficult for her to do and
her great strength helped Molly and Billie out of
many a quagmire of work that seemed too heavy
for them to accomplish without masculine aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now Oi&rsquo;m ready for to help put oop the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
little play houses,&rdquo; she said as she joined Molly
and Billie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said her mistress, &ldquo;but before
we begin, just let&rsquo;s smell the ploughed ground a
little. Don&rsquo;t you love it, Katy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! And it beats the perfumery that
comes in a bottle, to my moind,&rdquo; said the girl,
sniffing delightedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they don&rsquo;t bottle the smell of
new ploughed earth just as they have new mown
hay,&rdquo; laughed Billie. &ldquo;I know two who would
want to buy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deed and Oi&rsquo;d buy a gallon of sooch smells!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Masefield&rsquo;s &lsquo;Everlasting
Mercy,&rsquo; Billie? You and Katy listen while I tell
you the part about ploughing and then we&rsquo;ll put
up the tent houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very charming was the picture made by this
group of girls. So Edwin Green thought as he
walked silently across the lawn of the old farm.
Katy, the sturdy Irish girl, was not without picturesque
lines. Her look was somewhat that of
Bastien Lepage&rsquo;s peasant Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
stood in rapt reverie while her beloved mistress
gave voice to those wonderful lines of England&rsquo;s
greatest modern poet. Billie looked very down-to-date
in her khaki overalls and stubby shoes,
while Molly was very Mollyesque in the blue
linen blouse that was the only true Molly Brown
blue.</p>

<p>She did not hear her husband as he stepped
lightly across the green spring grass and he motioned
to Billie not to let her know he was there.
He stood silently, with bared head while she recited.
Molly&rsquo;s voice had always appealed to Edwin,
in fact it had been the first thing that had
attracted him&mdash;and when Molly recited poetry!</p>

<p>Katy wiped her eyes and Billie winked away
the tears that would gather. Molly turned and
saw Edwin standing only a few feet from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edwin, I didn&rsquo;t know you were there.
I declare I haven&rsquo;t been spouting poetry ever
since we got here! We have done a lot and were
going now to put up the tent houses, but you
aren&rsquo;t to help. I&rsquo;ll give you some tea and let you
rest up after your tramp. We weren&rsquo;t expecting
you until Saturday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t want me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want you! Why, Edwin Green, B.&nbsp;A.,
M.&nbsp;A., P.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;D.! You know I always want
you,&rdquo; and then Billie and Katy thought it was
time to leave the married lovers alone for a while.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to help put up the houses, though,&rdquo;
insisted Edwin as he and Molly wended their
way to a pretty little arbor covered by a crimson
rambler that gave promise, if one might judge
from the many buds, of being a glorious sight
later in the season.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can do it later by our lonesomes. You
don&rsquo;t know how many things we can do without
the help of men, especially when one of us is as
powerful as Katy and one as spunky as Billie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how about you?&rdquo; and he pinched her rosy
cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not much force, I am afraid, but I
have the bump of stickativeness which is sometimes
as good as strength and takes the place of
cleverness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think you girls could run this
farm without the help of a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we could, once the heavy ploughing
is done, and Katy says she could have done
that, too, if we had wanted her to. Do you want
to go off on a trip somewhere and let us try to
run it without you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Edwin looked searchingly into Molly&rsquo;s blue
eyes. His gaze was long and earnest and in his
brown eyes Molly read a kind of sadness she had
never seen there before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edwin, dearest, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Molly, it isn&rsquo;t anything unless you want it
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you think it right or wrong if I
should try to get into the service, military service,
I mean?&mdash;I have taken an examination and am
physically fit.&mdash;I won&rsquo;t apply to go into training
at Fort Myer unless you approve.&mdash;It rests entirely
with you, honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go if you think it right.&rdquo; Molly
spoke without a tremor, although it did seem to
her for a moment as though her heart would
burst. How could a heart get so big all of a sudden?
And then it seemed to her she was sounding
cold and unemotional when Edwin wanted something
else. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;want you to go! I think it
is right for men just like you to go&mdash;men with
brains and the power of taking hold and leading&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
wouldn&rsquo;t have you stay behind for me for
anything on earth. I&mdash;I&mdash;am proud of you and
want you to do exactly what you think is right,
and&mdash;and&mdash;I think you are right&mdash;just as right
as can be&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I love you more than
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to both Edwin and Molly that at
no time since their walk in the forest of Fontainebleau
when the eternal question had been settled
between them had any moment been so filled with
love and understanding as now when he folded
her in his arms. His Molly! His own, brave,
true Molly! Her Edwin! Her honorable,
courageous Edwin!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that I could content myself by
digging and delving, but somehow I have been
feeling lately that if you would consent, it was up
to me to do something else. I don&rsquo;t feel critical
in the least towards the men of my age who are
not going to the war,&mdash;not the younger ones,
either, if they do not feel called upon,&mdash;but somehow
when one has been called as I have, I think
he should answer. I don&rsquo;t know why a staid college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
professor should think it is his vocation, but
I do think it, and, oh, dearest, it is good of you
to take it this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could take it no other way. Is not my
mother giving God-speed to her sons? Is not
Judy encouraging Kent? Is not Nance not only
sending Andy but going with him? Who am I
that I should say you shall and you shan&rsquo;t do
things for your country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see, dear girl, there are the children
to take care of in case&mdash;in case&mdash;in case I should&mdash;should&mdash;well&mdash;stump
my toe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take care of them as my mother did
of all of us. My father died when I was a tiny
child and still my mother raised me. But don&rsquo;t
stump your toe. Pick up your feet when you
walk&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Molly came very near shedding the tears
that she felt must be shed sooner or later, but she
was determined that it should be later and that
her soldier boy should not see them. She jumped
up and offered to race him to the house where
Katy was laying the tea table on the porch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Edwin knew Molly too well not to understand
that this gaiety was nothing but camouflage to
conceal emotions that she was too brave to show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will your mother think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will think that I have married well,&rdquo; was
her gay rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what does my Mildred think when I
tell her her daddy is going to be a soldier?&rdquo; he
asked as he held the little girl close in his arms.</p>

<p>Mildred had been busy with a tiny hoe and
shovel on a patch of ground given over to her
tender ministrations. Her hands were very
grubby and her face not much better, but Edwin
seemed not to mind the general griminess of his
daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say bully for Daddy! An&rsquo; I bet if
Dodo&rsquo;ll wake up, he&rsquo;d say he was a-goin&rsquo;, too.
Boys is so rombustious.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="star2">******</p>

<p>And now we must leave Molly Brown and
her College Friends at the momentous hour when
their country is plunged in a great and righteous
war. What the future holds for them is as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
a mystery as what it holds for any of us. One
thing is sure: Molly is doing her duty,&mdash;doing it
cheerfully and bravely. Around her are college
girls and more college girls, each one doing her
bit. And so the fields are ploughed, the crops
are planted and gathered. Fruit and vegetables
are preserved and canned. The men and boys
are training for the trenches, but the women and
girls are in training, too.</p>

<p>Molly often thinks of that moment when she
stood sniffing the up-turned mould, with her husband
standing near listening to her as she recited
the lines from Masefield; and now as the days
multiply she finds comfort in Masefield&rsquo;s ending
to &ldquo;The Everlasting Mercy&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
